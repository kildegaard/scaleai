Dear contributor, I have reviewed your task and regret to inform you that it did not meet the minimum requirements to be approvable.
The prompt itself lacks many of the key items needed for it to be considered good: it has no context, nor any constraint attached to it. It has no details whatsoever: you need to tell the LLM what you want and how you want it to be. As this is, it's too open-ended. Another thing to consider is that you should provide something that can be testable and, moreover, something that you could have correctly tested. In this case that did not happen. In fact, the responses did not answer the prompt either. It was supposed to be real-time, but response 1 does it with a CSV file and response 2 does it with a string. Both of them failed and you did not mention that in the justification. You should be capable of analyzing this kind of thing, and deliver a proper argument for what's going on.
Please consider increasing the overall quality of this task by implementing these tips I told you. I'll share with you documentation that will come in handy.
