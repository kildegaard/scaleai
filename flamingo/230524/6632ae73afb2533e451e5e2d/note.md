# Prompt
Develop a javascript program that analyzes historical stock price data and provides insights for potential investors. The program will process a provided dataset in JSON format containing historical daily stock prices for a particular company. Each data point in the JSON should include:
date - string representing the date in YYYY-MM-DD format
open - float representing the opening price for the day
high - float represents the highest price reached during the day
low - float represents the lowest price for the day
close - float representing the closing price for the day
volume - an integer representing the number of shares traded for the day.

Functionality:
Data loading - the program should be able to read the data from a JSON file or directly from a provided JSON string
Price analysis - calculate the daily price change (close - open) for each day. Identify the day with the highest and lowest closing price. Calculate the average daily trading volume over the entire period. Identify periods of significant price volatility.


# Justif original
Response 2 uses objects within the volatile periods array to store start date, end date, and price change information. This provides a more organized way to represent the data compared to response 1's simple array of dates.

# Justif modif
Response 2 uses objects within the volatile periods array to store start date, end date, and price change information. This provides a more organized way to represent the data compared to response 1's simple array of dates.
Besides this, there are no main differences nor deviations between response and response 2, they are pretty much the same.
Both codes were locally tested at a Visual Studio Code environment.

# Prompt
Implement technical indicators that add calculations for basic technical indicators like simple moving averages and relative strength index to provide more insights for potential investors. These indicators can be calculated based on the existing daily price data.

# Justif original
Overall, both responses achieve the same goal of adding technical indicators.

# Justif modif
Both, Response 1 and Response 2, correctly answered the follow-up prompt.
There are some differences between them, like for example the time window for the SMA calculation. Response 1 uses 50 and 200 days, whereas response 2 uses 20 and 50 days. As this was not specified in the prompt, then there's no deviation.

Overall, both responses achieve the same goal of adding technical indicators. Codes were tested as before, using VSScode within a Node JS environment to run them.

# Prompt
Extend the program to monitor for specific events based on the analysis. For example, sets up alerts to notify users when the prices reach a certain threshold or a period of high volatility is detected.

# Justif original
Both response 1 and response 2 implement alerts and have the same RSI overbought or oversold thresholds of 70/30, and they also trigger an alert for any period of volatility. However, response 1 includes another condition when using price relative to 50-day SMA (10% above or below) to trigger alerts that provide more specific price movement.

# Justif modif
Both response 1 and response 2 implement alerts and have the same RSI overbought or oversold thresholds of 70/30, and the also trigger an alert for any period of volatility.
However, response 1 includes another condition when using price relative to 50-day SMA (10% above or below) to trigger altera that provide more specific price movement.
Because of this extra info, response 1 is slightly better than response 2.
But because this was not asked in the prompt, then there's no deviation across any dimension. Also, codes where seamlessly tested as before.

# Feedback

Hello, dear Tasker. Thanks a lot for your commitment to the actual project.
I reviewed your work and wanted to share my thoughts.

According to actual guidelines, your prompts are very good in terms of complexity and context, but have some minor issues to deal with; your justifications are good too, but lack some compulsory elements for them to be excellent ones.

Your prompts need to have a certain structure considering the following:
- Context: giving some environmental information will buff your prompt as the model has information to be more specific and clever.
- Clear objectives: well-explained goals for the code or problem to achieve.
- Use cases: propose uses for the code to be useful within specific situations
- Constraints: adding extra spice to the model is a good way to increase its quality. Think about specific limitations to take into account or restrictions that would make the problem non-trivial.
- Uniqueness: as stated previously, your problem must provide some fresh ideas to the prompt pool. It's expected for you to write problems that are not so easily found on the internet.
- Complexity: Once again, as stated before, the problem must not be trivial. It would be best if you aimed for issues that require some effort for the model, that provide a clear yet not easy way for solving them.

In your case, the first prompt was very good but could have more complexity introducing some constraints to it. It's a good example, it's very useful in real life and also testable, which is a very important thing too. Follow-up prompts were less complex, it would be nice to have more constraints in them.

Another topic to engage in is justifications: in the documentation, there's plenty of information to learn some workflow to tackle this. I'll add them at the end for you to later consults.

Your justification also lacks development in it. Some things can be done to improve it further. For example, it is important to show evidence in the responses to support your response selection. You must also claim where's the deviation (in case there is), or analyze why there is not.

Another thing that is of extreme importance is to test your code factually (as stated before). Not only test it, but show some evidence that you did, and share the environment set for this. It's important because if the reviewer can not rut it, or if it's too complicated and time-consuming to set the correct environment, then your task is most probably going to be sent back to you. Please consider this!

Keynote for future justifications: I will show you a systematic way of building excellent-quality justifications.

Comparison between responses + Along which dimension? + Epic quality justification + Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code, and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.


With all this, I truly believe you can develop perfect stellar prompts that would make the model thrive to create astonishing responses.

Thanks a lot for reading till the end! I wish you the best on this, I know you have what is needed for the project!
