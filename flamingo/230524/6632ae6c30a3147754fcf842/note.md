# Prompt

I am currently grappling with setting up a python based distributed logging system for a massive microservice setup. Honestly, it's been a bit of a headache. I have got hundreds of services churning out logs so fast that it's causing delays and even losing data here and there. I really need to get a handle on this with a slick system that can use distributed databases and crunch data on the fly. Now, I need you to figure out a way to gather, crunch, and stash these logs so they are easy to pull up for real-time analysis and  don't slow us down. I need this system to be powerhouse that can handle heavy loads and not miss a beat.

# Justif
Response 1 is better than response 2, because it suggests a highly functional and performant system, considering real time processing, scalability, and integrative visualization. Response 2 also emphasizes performance but places more focus on processing and technical flexibility with the inclusion of Apache Beam for pipeline definition
