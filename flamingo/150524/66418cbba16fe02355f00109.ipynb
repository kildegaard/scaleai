    "I live in a tourist city. Each summer, we have a large number of tourists who come to visit the famous landmarks of the city, but they encounter a lack of apartments. I want to help the city by creating an apartment rental program to control the renting process of the apartments. I want to make a controller class with a name, place, and a list of apartments. Make an apartment class with price per night, type, size, \"is_available\" attribute, and number of rooms. Provide methods for adding apartments and renting them. When renting an apartment, make sure of availability and calculate the entire cost on the number of nights needed. Additionally, give a function to adjust the price of the apartment based on the current date. During peak season (the summer holiday), the price will increase by 49%. Include a damage assessment feature during apartment retrieval. This involves a new method in controller class that compares the apartment's condition before and after rental. A damage fee will be calculated based on the severity (minor scratches vs. major breakage). Give a method that recommends a size based on the tourist's number of family members. The revenue must be in the controller class. The revenue will be calculated using a new method when the tourist finishes his stay in the apartment. Implement error handling for scenarios such as an unavailable apartment before a rental. Allow tourists to cancel their reservation and make the apartment available again. Add comments in the code to describe each step for an intermediate programmer."
