# Prompt

I am developing an inventory management system for a bookstore. The bookstore has multiple sections such as Fiction, Non-Fiction, Science, and Children's Books. Each section has several shelves, and each shelf contains multiple books. Each book has its title, author, price, and availability status. The data is stored in Python dictionaries. I need a Python function that accepts a section as an argument and returns a list of available books in that section. Additionally, I need another function that accepts a section and a shelf as arguments and returns the available books on that shelf.
