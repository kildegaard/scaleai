Contributor, your prompt does not completely align with the actual guidelines. The code you provided, while interesting in its main idea, fails to be testable.
There are many functions that are not implemented and that are needed to test the code itself. Without them, there is nothing that I can do. Moreover, you are supposed to always write testable code even in this new Debugging taxonomy.
Your code must be totally encapsulated so that its functionality can be analyzed and so that the model can create good debugging feedback.
On the other hand, your justifications also lack some structure and have certain issues that I would like to discuss.
You wrote in the first justification "Response 1 is likely to compile and run with minor adjustments (correcting the encryption method).". Again, you must always be able to check your code and do it in a way that you have no doubts about the correct functionality.
