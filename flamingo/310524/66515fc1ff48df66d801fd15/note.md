# Prompts

There seems to be a bug preventing correct execution or output generation. Can you identify and fix it?

```javascript
function calculateSum(array) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= array.length; i++) {
        sum += array[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log("Sum of numbers:", calculateSum(numbers));
```


Based on the debugging task you just completed, provide an explanation of the bug you identified and the steps you took to fix it. Additionally, describe any potential risks or edge cases associated with the corrected code.


# Feedback

Dear Contributor, your prompt is extremely simple and does not align with actual Guidelines. It has no complexity at all, no constraints, no context, and most definitely, not unique. Your follow-up prompt lacks the same. You did not deepen into more constraints or new situations; you just explained the same things again. Along the same line, your justifications did not excel in their analysis of the responses either.

You need to focus on creating a good prompt that has at least some constraints or context to make the Model work to a decent level. Consider that the minimum level of complexity is expected to be  "a recent college grad that is starting their first job as a junior programmer".

Please, redo this task from the first turn with these considerations. I will attach useful documentation that will come in handy.
