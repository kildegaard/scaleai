# Prompt 1

Consider the following JavaScript class that represents a simple To-Do list. The class includes methods to add, remove, and list tasks. However, the code lacks comments, docstrings, and comprehensive documentation.

```javascript
class TodoList {
    constructor() {
        this.tasks = [];
    }

    addTask(task) {
        if (task && typeof task === 'string') {
            this.tasks.push({ task, completed: false });
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    removeTask(task) {
        const index = this.tasks.findIndex(t => t.task === task);
        if (index !== -1) {
            this.tasks.splice(index, 1);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    listTasks() {
        return this.tasks;
    }

    markCompleted(task) {
        const foundTask = this.tasks.find(t => t.task === task);
        if (foundTask) {
            foundTask.completed = true;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

Please perform the following tasks:
1. Add comments within the code to clarify its intention and functionality.
2. Add docstrings to describe the purpose of each function.
3. Write a detailed explanation of how the provided code works.
4. Create comprehensive documentation detailing the usage and purpose of the class and its methods.
5. Write a commit message for adding the comments, docstrings, and documentation to the codebase.


# justif 1

There is no deviation because both responses adequately fulfill the prompt requirements by adding comments, docstrings, and documentation to the code. Response 1 is only slightly better due to its more comprehensive and detailed documentation, but both responses are correct and functional.
The code was successfully tested in VS Code using Node.js.


# Prompt 2

Excellent work on enhancing the code with comments and documentation! Let's further improve the robustness and usability of the `TodoList` class. Please perform the following tasks:

1. Refactor the `addTask`, `removeTask`, and `markCompleted` methods to throw custom error messages (`Error` objects) instead of returning `false` when an operation fails.
2. Create a custom error class `TodoListError` that will be used for all errors thrown by these methods.
3. Update the documentation to reflect these changes, including details on the new error handling behavior.
4. Provide an example usage demonstrating how to handle these custom errors in the calling code, including try-catch blocks for each method.


# Justif 2 original

Response 1 is better than Response 2 in terms of Relevance & Completeness. Specifically, Response 1 includes comprehensive error handling with detailed and clear error messages in the `addTask`, `removeTask`, and `markCompleted` methods (lines 13-37). Additionally, the example usage (lines 40-64) demonstrates how to handle these errors using try-catch blocks, which is more extensive and covers multiple methods. These improvements enhance the usability and robustness of the code. 

In contrast, Response 2's error handling and example usage are less detailed and do not cover as many scenarios. Response 1's thorough documentation and clear error messages make it objectively better in providing a complete and relevant solution.

# Justif 2 mejorada

Le baj√© de 2 a 4

Both responses answered the prompt completely, as they created a custom class `TodoListError` for errors thrown, refactored the methods by adding the custom error messages, and updated the documentation of the whole code (now with error handling). They also provided examples of the usage.
Because of this, there is not a clear deviation between response 1 and response 2.
Codes were tested in the same environment as before with success.


# PRompt 3

Great job on enhancing the error handling! Let's further improve the functionality and performance of the `TodoList` class.

Please perform the following tasks:

1. Refactor the `listTasks` method to allow filtering based on completion status and sorting by task name or completion status.
2. Update the documentation to reflect these new functionalities.
3. Provide example usage demonstrating filtering and sorting.
4. Suggest and implement any additional optimizations to improve performance and scalability, if any.


# Justif 3

Response 1 is better because it provides thorough documentation and clear example usage that effectively demonstrate the new filtering and sorting functionalities. Additionally, it includes specific optimizations like creating a copy of the array before sorting to avoid modifying the original array, which enhances the code's functionality and preserves data integrity. These aspects make Response 1 more relevant and complete compared to Response 2.


# Justif 3 mejorada

le baje de 2 a 3

Both responses answered the prompt correctly and completely. They created a filtering and sorting method, with updated documentation and test cases.
Despite this, response 1 provides more thorough and clear documentation demonstrating the new filtering and sorting functionalities.  Because of this, it is slightly better than response 2.
With these facts, we can conclude that this turn has no deviation. Once more, codes were locally tested with no issues whatsoever.


# Feedback

Dear Contributor, very good work on this task! Your prompts were really good indeed. The justifications had some issues that I corrected. For example, you marked in turn 2 and 3 that there were deviations where there were none. I have corrected the rating and justification accordingly.
Very good work overall!! Keep it up :)
