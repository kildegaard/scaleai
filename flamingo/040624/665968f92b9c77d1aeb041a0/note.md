# Prompt 1
You are working on a project that involves building a web application using Python and the Flask framework. You've written a function to handle user registration, but you realize that it lacks proper error handling and documentation.

Here's the function you've implemented:
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

def register_user(username, email, password):
    """
    Register a new user.

    Parameters:
        username (str): The username of the new user.
        email (str): The email address of the new user.
        password (str): The password of the new user.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing a success message if registration is successful,
              or an error message if registration fails.
    """
    if not username or not email or not password:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required fields'}), 400
    
    # Check if email is already registered
    # Dummy implementation, replace with actual database check
    if email == 'existing@email.com':
        return jsonify({'error': 'Email already registered'}), 400
    
    # Dummy implementation, always return success
    return jsonify({'message': 'User registered successfully'}), 200

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def handle_registration():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data.get('username')
    email = data.get('email')
    password = data.get('password')
    return register_user(username, email, password)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
 Edit the register_user function to include proper error handling for cases such as missing fields and existing email addresses. Additionally, add comments to clarify the functionality of each part of the function. Once done, provide a commit message for the changes made to the codebase.


# Justif 1 ya modificada

Response 1 is superior because it not only includes proper error handling for missing fields and existing email addresses but also adds exception handling to catch any unexpected errors during the registration process. This enhances the robustness of the function, ensuring that it can handle a wider range of scenarios. Additionally, Response 1 provides clear comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each part of the function, improving code readability and maintainability. Despite all these things, the implementation of error handling is a little vague by the model and adds lots of comments.
On the other hand, Response 2 does add inline comments to the code but does nothing about the error handling.
Because of this, I conclude there is a clear deviation along the Relevance & Completeness dimension.
Codes were tested using Visual Studio Code, and the appropriate libraries were installed. I then ran the Flask server in a terminal window. With Postman application I sent a Post package to the `http://127.0.0.1/register` Endpoint, with a JSON in its body like this one:
{
  "username": "pepito_grillo",
  "email": "pepito@grillo.com",
  "password": "gepetto_123"
}
The server responded with this answer:
{"message": "User registered successfully}

All codes ran successfully with no issues.


# Feedback

Dear Contributor, thanks for your time on this project!
Your first prompt is perfect: in has all that is asked for. As for its justification, it was acceptable, though it had some issues that I care to correct. I would suggest you read it to get an idea of the correct way of presenting it.

The main issue with your task (and the reason for the SBQ) is that your second prompt is not a follow-up prompt. You must write follow-up prompts that continue the main idea. You gave a code for enhancing and adding documentation, so your follow-ups must have something to do with this.
Please, redo your task from the 2nd turn taking this into account.

Additionally, I will share with you some good prompt & justification tips.

Prompts need to have a certain structure considering the following:
- Context: giving some environmental information will buff your prompt as the model has information to be more specific and clever.
- Clear objectives: well-explained goals for the code or problem to achieve.
- Use cases: propose uses for the code to be useful within specific situations
- Constraints: adding extra spice to the model is a good way to increase its quality. Think about specific limitations to take into account or restrictions that would make the problem non-trivial.
- Uniqueness: as stated previously, your problem must provide some fresh ideas to the prompt pool. It's expected for you to write problems that are not so easily found on the internet.
- Complexity: Once again, as stated before, the problem must not be trivial. It would be best if you aimed for issues that require some effort for the model, that provide a clear yet not easy way for solving them.

Another topic to engage in is justifications: in the documentation, there's plenty of information to learn some workflow to tackle this. I'll add them at the end for you to later consults.
Your justification also lacks development in it. Some things can be done to improve it further. For example, it is important to show evidence in the responses to support your response selection. You must also claim where's the deviation (in case there is), or analyze why there is not.

Another thing that is of extreme importance is to test your code factually (as stated before). Not only test it, but show some evidence that you did, and share the environment set for this. It's important because if the reviewer can not rut it, or if it's too complicated and time-consuming to set the correct environment, then your task is most probably going to be sent back to you. Please consider this!

Keynote for future justifications: I will show you a systematic way of building excellent-quality justifications.

Comparison between responses + Along which dimension? + Epic quality justification + Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code, and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.


With all this, I truly believe you can develop perfect stellar prompts that would make the model thrive to create astonishing responses.

Thanks a lot for reading till the end! I wish you the best on this, I know you have what is needed for the project!
