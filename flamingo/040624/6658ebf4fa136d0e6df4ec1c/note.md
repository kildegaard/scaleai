# Prompt 1
I'm a beginner in algorithms, especially in dynamic programming in Python, so I need inline comments and docstrings to describe the purpose of functions, especially `calculate_evacuation_plan` function in this code.
```
def validate_evacuation_inputs(num_players, player_strengths, num_requests):
    if not isinstance(num_players, int) or num_players <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of players must be a positive integer.")
    if not isinstance(player_strengths, list) or not all(isinstance(p, int) for p in player_strengths):
        raise ValueError("Player strengths must be a list of integers.")
    if not isinstance(num_requests, int) or num_requests <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of evacuation requests must be a positive integer.")


def display_evacuation_statistics(total_evacuated, evacuation_history, average_strength):
    print("Total evacuated players:", total_evacuated)
    print("Evacuation Details:")
    for i, (request, players_evacuated) in enumerate(evacuation_history):
        print(f"Request {i + 1}: {request}, Evacuated Players: {players_evacuated}")
    print("Average strength of evacuated players:", average_strength)


def calculate_evacuation_plan(num_players, player_strengths, requests):
    validate_evacuation_inputs(num_players, player_strengths, len(requests))


    num_requests = len(requests)

    dp = [[0] * (num_requests + 1) for _ in range(num_players + 1)]

    evacuation_history = [[] for _ in range(num_requests)]

    for j in range(1, num_requests + 1):
        req_players, max_strength_limit = requests[j - 1]
        for i in range(1, num_players + 1):
            if i >= req_players:
                current_sum = sum(player_strengths[i - req_players:i])
                if current_sum <= max_strength_limit:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - req_players][j - 1] + current_sum)
                    if dp[i][j] > dp[i - 1][j]:
                        evacuation_history[j - 1] = (requests[j - 1], player_strengths[i - req_players:i])
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j])

    total_evacuated = max(dp[num_players])

    evacuated_players = [player for _, players_evacuated in evacuation_history for player in players_evacuated]
    total_strength_evacuated = sum(evacuated_players)
    average_strength_evacuated = total_strength_evacuated / len(evacuated_players) if evacuated_players else 0

    return total_evacuated, evacuation_history, average_strength_evacuated


if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_players = int(input("Enter number of players: "))
    player_strengths = list(map(int, input("Enter player strengths: ").split()))

    requests = []
    num_requests = int(input("Enter number of evacuation requests: "))
    for _ in range(num_requests):
        req_players, max_strength_limit = map(int, input().split())
        requests.append((req_players, max_strength_limit))

    total_evacuated, evacuation_history, average_strength_evacuated = calculate_evacuation_plan(num_players,
                                                                                                player_strengths,
                                                                                                requests)

    display_evacuation_statistics(total_evacuated, evacuation_history, average_strength_evacuated)
```

Both responses provide inline comments and docstrings to describe the purpose of functions, which aligns with the prompt. They both succeed in creating good-quality docstrings for each of the functions along the code and inline comments for each relevant step.
However, response 1 slightly better overall presentation and readability of the code.
Original and response's code were tested successfully with this test case:

Input:
Number of players: 5
Player strengths: 3 5 2 1 4
Number of evacuation requests: 2

Output:
Total evacuated players: 12
Evacuation Details:
Request 1: (2, 8), Evacuated Players: [3, 5]
Request 2: (1, 6), Evacuated Players: [4]
Average strength of evacuated players: 4.0



# Prompt 2
Refactored dynamic programming logic in `calculate_evacuation_plan` for efficiency, enhanced input validation in `validate_evacuation_inputs` for edge cases, and improved code clarity with consistent variable names.


# Justif 2

Both responses summarize the changes made to the codebase effectively to what the prompt asks. The model introduced several modifications into the asked function (`calculate_evacuation_plan`), like memory optimization (replacing the 2D table for a 1D array, `max_strength`) and also enhanced input validation (adding a check to ensure that the number of player strengths matches the number of players (line 17 on both codes)).

When testing the new codes with the same input as in the previous turn, there is a difference in people being evacuated: from 12 in the original code to 7 in the new ones (same for Response 1 and Response 2). The reason for this relies on optimization differences: while optimizing the dynamic programming approach, this could lead to different decision paths being taken.

Because of all this, Response 1 is hardly better than Response 2, leading to no deviations in this turn.

# Feedback

Dear Contributor, very good job!! Your prompt is very good in terms of the guidelines and what is asked. Your follow-up prompt is also good, retaining some complexity in itself and does not deviate from the principal topic.
In the same picture, both justifications were fine. They had the minimum required key items in them, but I noticed that you tested them in Pycharm and said that some of them ran with errors. I disagree with that. I tested them in Visual Studio Code using Python version 3.11 with no issues whatsoever. So I modified the justification accordingly.

Also, for future tasks, I recommend testing the code and explicit how you did it. You can check the new justifications to assess this for your own tasks.

Good job, keep it up!!
