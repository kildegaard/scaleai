Dear Attempter, excellent job on this task! Your prompts were very good within the category of Documentation. The second prompt could have been a little better if it had a bit more complexity or if it asked the Model to add new features. Despite being a Documentation & Editing task, the follow-up prompts' subject can be like normal tasks and not just editing-related.
Your justifications were also very good: they were very complete and analyzed everything that was needed. Good job on that!
Thanks for your time, you did very well! Congrats on that. Keep up the hard work!
