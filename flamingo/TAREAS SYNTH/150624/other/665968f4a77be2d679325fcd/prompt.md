I’m building a backend for a coffee shop and need some advice. I’m using Node.js with Express to manage orders, loyalty program and inventory. MySQL will be the database for the structured data of orders and loyalty points. Main features include: Order Management: Process orders, custom drinks. Loyalty Program: Track purchases and award points. Ingredient Inventory: Monitor stock levels and reorder. User interaction will be customers placing and customizing orders, signing up for loyalty program and earning points on purchases. Baristas will log in to update inventory and redeem loyalty points. For data management, orders and loyalty points will be stored in MySQL which is good at handling structured data. Node.js will manage the order process, update inventory and loyalty points in real time. Secure sessions will store customer data and order history. Main processes will be updating inventory after each order and calculating loyalty points. Baristas need to keep stock levels accurate and points management efficient. Synchronizing inventory updates with frequent orders especially during rush hours might be tricky. Any ideas on how to handle high frequency data updates?
