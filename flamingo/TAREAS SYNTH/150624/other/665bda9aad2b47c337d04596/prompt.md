Make a game where you control a chariot in ancient Rome. Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the Canvas API to draw the game. The chariot goes around a circular track, avoiding columns and other chariots. Use the arrow keys to steer the chariot. The chariot starts at the bottom of the track and moves automatically. You must navigate around obstacles and keep speed. Each lap is a point. The game ends after 2 minutes and you must complete as many laps as you can. The chariot is a small rectangle, obstacles are random shapes and the track is a loop around the screen.
