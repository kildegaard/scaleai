I’m building a website for my environmental consulting business. I want to use plain JavaScript and HTML to create a page where users can see interactive charts of environmental data. I’ll use Chart.js to display charts for air quality, water usage and energy consumption. The main page will have a dashboard with several charts and a dropdown menu to filter the data by region or time period. When a user selects a filter the charts should update to show the relevant data. I’ll pull the data from a local JSON file and use JavaScript to update the charts dynamically. The site should be simple and clean and adapt to different screen sizes.
