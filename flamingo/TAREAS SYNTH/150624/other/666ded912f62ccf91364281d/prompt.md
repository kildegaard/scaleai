I’m setting up a website for my flower shop where customers can browse and order flowers. I’ll use React to create a product page with a grid of arrangements. Each arrangement will have a card with a photo, name, price and an “Add to Cart” button. When a customer clicks “Add to Cart” the item will be added to a cart that appears at the top of the page. The cart will show the items added and the total. I need you to create mock data for the arrangements in a JSON file that the site will load and display dynamically. I’ll also add a feature to filter the arrangements by occasion (birthdays, weddings, anniversaries). The site will be lovely and easy to use, with a responsive design that looks good on all devices.
