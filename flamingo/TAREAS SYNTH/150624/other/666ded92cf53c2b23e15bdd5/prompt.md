For my local gym I need a website where members can view class schedules and book sessions. I’ll use plain JavaScript and HTML to create a schedule page with a calendar view. Each day on the calendar will show a list of available classes with their names, times and a “Book Now” button. When a member clicks “Book Now” it will open a form where they can enter their details and confirm their booking. The form will validate the inputs and show a success message upon submission. I need you to create mock data for the class schedules in a JSON file that the site will load and display dynamically. I’ll also add a membership section where users can view their membership status and upcoming classes. The site will be fun and user friendly with a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile.
