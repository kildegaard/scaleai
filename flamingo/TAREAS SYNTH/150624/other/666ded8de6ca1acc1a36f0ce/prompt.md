For my B&B I need a website where guests can see room availability and book. I’ll use React to create a booking page with a calendar of available dates. The page will have a form to select check in and check out dates, room type and contact details. When they submit the form it will validate the inputs and confirm the booking if the dates are available. I’ll use React state to manage the calendar and form data. The homepage will have a nice design with a big banner image, short intro and link to the booking page. The site will be responsive so it’s easy to use on desktop and mobile.
