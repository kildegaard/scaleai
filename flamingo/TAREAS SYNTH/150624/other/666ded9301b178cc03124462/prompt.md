For my food truck I need a website where customers can see the menu and track the truck. I’ll use Vue.js to create a menu page with a list of items. Each item will have a card with name, price and an “Order Now” button. When a customer clicks “Order Now” it should open a form where they can select quantity and enter their contact info. The form will validate the inputs to make sure all required fields are filled out correctly. I need you to create mock menu items in a JSON file that the site will load and display dynamically. To keep customers up to date with the truck’s location I’ll add an interactive map that shows the current location of the food truck in real-time. The site will be fun and easy to use with a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile.
