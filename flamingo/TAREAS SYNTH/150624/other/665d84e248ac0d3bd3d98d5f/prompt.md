Create a game where the player controls a shooter that shoots at incoming shapes. Use JavaScript, HTML and CSS and draw the game using the Canvas API. The shooter moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen and shapes fall from the top. Use the arrow keys to move the shooter and the spacebar to shoot. Each shape hit by a shot gives points and missing a shape loses points. The game lasts 60 seconds and the goal is to hit as many shapes as possible. The shooter is a small triangle, shots are lines and shapes are various geometric forms like circles, squares and triangles falling from the top.
