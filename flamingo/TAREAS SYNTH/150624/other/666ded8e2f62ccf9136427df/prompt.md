I’m building a website for my digital marketing agency where clients can view our services and request quotes. I’ll use plain JavaScript and HTML to create a services page with a list of services. Each service will have a card with the name, description and a “Get Quote” button. When a client clicks “Get Quote” it will open a form where they can enter their details and describe their marketing needs. The form will validate the inputs to make sure all required fields are filled out correctly. I need you to create mock data for the services in a JSON file that the site will load and display dynamically. I’ll also add a portfolio section where I can showcase past marketing campaigns with case studies and results. The site will be professional and user friendly with a responsive design that looks good on desktop and mobile.
