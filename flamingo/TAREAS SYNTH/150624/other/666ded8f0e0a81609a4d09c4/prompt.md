For my local brewery I need a website where customers can view our beer selection and book brewery tours. I’ll use React to create a product page with a grid of beers. Each beer will have a card with the name, type, price and a “More Info” button. When a customer clicks “More Info” it should open a new page with more info about the beer and a booking form. I’ll add a booking form to the tour page where customers can enter their details and select a date for the tour. The form will validate the inputs to make sure all required fields are filled out correctly. I need you to create mock data for the beers and tours in a JSON file that the site will load and display. I’ll also add a rating system where customers can rate the beers and leave comments. The site will be friendly and fun and responsive on all devices.
