For my pet adoption center I need a website where visitors can view available pets and submit adoption applications. I’ll use React to create a pets page with a grid of animal profiles. Each profile will have a card with a photo, name, age, breed and an “Adopt Me” button. When a visitor clicks “Adopt Me” it should open a form where they can enter their details and express their interest in adopting the animal. The form will validate the inputs to make sure all required fields are filled out correctly. I need you to create mock data for the pets in a JSON file that the site will load and display dynamically. I’ll also add a feature where visitors can filter pets by type (dogs, cats, small animals) so they can find the perfect pet more easily. The site will be heartwarming and easy to use with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
