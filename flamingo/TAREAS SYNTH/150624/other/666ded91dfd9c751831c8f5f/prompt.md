For my cooking class business I need a website where users can see class schedules and register. I’ll use React to build a schedule page with a calendar view. Each day on the calendar will show a list of classes with names, times and a “Register Now” button. When a user clicks “Register Now” it should open a form where they can enter their details and confirm their registration. The form will validate the inputs and show a success message upon submission. I need you to create mock data for the class schedules in a JSON file that the site will load and display dynamically. I’ll also add a video preview feature where users can watch a short clip of the instructor explaining the class. The site will be fun and easy to use with a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile.
