For my custom furniture business I need a website where clients can see my work and request custom pieces. I’ll use Vue.js to create a portfolio page with a grid of furniture designs. Each design will have a card with a photo, name, description and a “Request Custom Piece” button. When a client clicks “Request Custom Piece” it should open a form where they can enter their details and describe the custom piece they want. The form will validate the inputs to make sure all required fields are filled in correctly. I need you to create mock data for the furniture designs in a JSON file that the site will load and display dynamically. I’ll also add a testimonials section where clients can read reviews from previous clients about their custom pieces. The site will be clean and easy to use with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
