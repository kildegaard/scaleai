 I'm looking to create a number guessing game using JavaScript, where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number. I’ll use JavaScript along with HTML and CSS for the game interface and handling the logic. Players will input their guesses and receive feedback on whether they are too high or too low. The game starts with the computer selecting a random number within a specified range. The objective is to guess the correct number with as few attempts as possible. After each guess, the player will be told if their guess is too high or too low. The game ends when the player guesses the correct number. The number and guesses will be displayed using simple text elements. Manage the logic for generating the random number, receiving and checking the player’s guesses, and providing feedback. Implementing the game’s loop and keeping track of the number of attempts are my main challenges. Can you provide some guidance on how to structure this game using JavaScript?
