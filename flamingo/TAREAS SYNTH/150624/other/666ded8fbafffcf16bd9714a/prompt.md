I’m building a Breakout game in JavaScript where the player controls a paddle to break bricks with a bouncing ball. I’ll use JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas to render the game and handle the interactions. The player will move the paddle left and right with the mouse or arrow keys to bounce the ball and hit the bricks. The game starts with the paddle at the bottom of the screen and a ball bouncing around. The goal is to break all the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the ball. Each brick hit disappears and the player scores points. The game ends if the ball falls below the paddle and all lives are lost. The paddle and ball will be simple shapes, a rectangle for the paddle and a circle for the ball. The bricks will be in rows and columns and will disappear when hit by the ball. Implement collision detection between the ball and the paddle, bricks and walls and calculate the ball’s bouncing angles. Can you help me with this using JavaScript and make it smooth?
