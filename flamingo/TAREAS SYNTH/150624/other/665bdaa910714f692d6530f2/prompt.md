For this project I need to create a puzzle game set in a jungle. Using JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the visuals, players will be shown a scrambled image of a jungle scene. They will have to unscramble the pieces to get the original image. The game will start with a grid of scrambled pieces that the player can click and swap. The pieces will snap into place when they are in the right position. The game will have a way for players to shuffle the pieces and restart if they get stuck. As the player progresses the puzzles will get harder with more pieces and less obvious placements. The game will end when the player completes the puzzle. Please make sure the interface is intuitive and visually pleasing, using plain JavaScript for the game logic.
