I need a website for my blacksmith shop. The main feature will be a product showcase with a simple slideshow. I’ll use Vue.js for this as it’s good with dynamic content. The slideshow will cycle through the images of my products and users can click the arrows to go to the next or previous image. Each slide will have a product image, name and price. Below the slideshow I’ll add buttons to filter products by category, like swords, knives or tools. When a category is selected the slideshow will update to show only products from that category. I’ll use Vue’s computed properties to manage the filtering and the current slide index. The site should be responsive and the slideshow should resize correctly on smaller screens.
