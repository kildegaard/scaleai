 I'm developing a website for a local alcoholic beverage store that offers a loyalty program to its customers. Using Node.js and plain JavaScript, the site will allow customers to sign up for the loyalty program and track their points. The homepage will have a section introducing the loyalty program with a sign-up form where customers can enter their name, email, and phone number. Once signed up, customers will be able to log in and view their loyalty points. The site will display a dashboard showing their current points, recent purchases, and available rewards. Each time a customer makes a purchase, they will earn points that can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases. I will use JavaScript to handle the form submissions and update the user's points dynamically. To manage the user's session and keep them logged in across different pages, I will implement a simple session management system using cookies. This will store the user's session data and keep them logged in until they log out or the session expires.
