I want to create a simple blog for my small business where I can post articles about my services. I want to use plain JavaScript and HTML so it’s easy to maintain. The blog should have a homepage that shows a list of article previews. Each preview should show the title, a short snippet and a “Read More” button. When someone clicks “Read More” it should take them to a full view of the article on a new page. I also want to add a search bar at the top. When users type in a keyword the page should filter the articles and show only the ones that match the search. I’ll be keeping the data in a local JSON file and fetching it with JavaScript. It should look good on both desktop and mobile devices so it should be responsive. The homepage should have a simple design with a header, footer and the list of articles in between. I’m thinking of using CSS Grid for the layout because it’s flexible and I can control how it looks on different screens.
