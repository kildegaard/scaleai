Make a pinball game with JavaScript. You control the flippers to keep the ball in play and score points. Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the Canvas API to draw. The ball starts in the middle and you use the left and right arrow keys to control the flippers. The ball bounces off the walls and obstacles, scores points when hitting certain targets. The game is over when the ball goes through the bottom. The ball is a small circle, flippers are rectangles and obstacles are various shapes around the playfield. The aim is to keep the ball in play as long as possible and score as many points as you can.
