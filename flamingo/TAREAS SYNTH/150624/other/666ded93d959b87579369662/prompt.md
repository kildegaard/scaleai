I’m building a website for my local bakery where customers can view products and order. I’ll use Vue.js to create a product page with a list of baked goods. Each item will have a card with a photo, name, price and an “Order Now” button. When a customer clicks “Order Now” it will open a form where they can select quantity and enter their contact info. The form will validate the inputs to make sure all required fields are filled out correctly. I need you to create mock data for the baked goods in a JSON file that the site will load and display dynamically. I’ll also add a carousel on the homepage that will feature products with nice images. The site will be cozy and warm and responsive so it will look good on all screen sizes.
