# Prompt

This Python implementation of the interpolation search algorithm requires some clarification. As a developer, I would appreciate an explanation of how it works. Additionally, please provide inline comments to make the code easier to follow. The comments should be concise and precise. For instance, use brief comments for initializing variables, specify the purpose for calculations, clarify the check for conditions, indicate the change for adjustments, and state the return outcome. Using this structure, please help me understand the interpolation search algorithm code.

``` Python
from __future__ import print_function
import bisect

try:
    raw_input
except NameError:
    raw_input = input

def interpolation_search(sorted_collection, item):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_collection) - 1

    while left <= right:
        point = left + ((item - sorted_collection[left]) * (right - left)) // (sorted_collection[right] - sorted_collection[left])
        
        if point<0 or point>=len(sorted_collection):
            return None

        current_item = sorted_collection[point]
        if current_item == item:
            return point
        else:
            if item < current_item:
                right = point - 1
            else:
                left = point + 1
    return None

def interpolation_search_by_recursion(sorted_collection, item, left, right):
    point = left + ((item - sorted_collection[left]) * (right - left)) // (sorted_collection[right] - sorted_collection[left])

    if point<0 or point>=len(sorted_collection):
        return None

    if sorted_collection[point] == item:
        return point
    elif sorted_collection[point] > item:
        return interpolation_search_by_recursion(sorted_collection, item, left, point-1)
    else:
        return interpolation_search_by_recursion(sorted_collection, item, point+1, right)
      
def __assert_sorted(collection):
    if collection != sorted(collection):
        raise ValueError('Collection must be sorted')
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys

    user_input = raw_input('Enter numbers separated by comma:\n').strip()
    collection = [int(item) for item in user_input.split(',')]
    try:
        __assert_sorted(collection)
    except ValueError:
        sys.exit('Sequence must be sorted to apply interpolation search')

    target_input = raw_input('Enter a single number to be found in the list:\n')
    target = int(target_input)
    result = interpolation_search(collection, target)
    if result is not None:
        print('{} found at positions: {}'.format(target, result))
    else:
        print('Not found')
```


# Justif orig

Response 1 is slightly better than response 2. 

Response 1's inline comments are more thorough and structured providing a step-by-step explanation that enhances the understanding of the interpolation search algorithm example like lines (1,10,21,23) and others you can check the difference.  

# Justif modif



Response 1 is really similar to Response 2 in terms of the code and clarity in their comments. Both succeded in generating good inline comments to better understand the usage of this interpolated search algorithm.

Also, both responses generated good non-code text explaining the algorithm and how to use it. So, no deviation was found between them.
I tested both codes in Visual Studio Code and worked really fine. The following queries were analyzed and the expected results in both codes were obtained:

Input: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Search for: 3
Output: 2 (OK)

Input: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5
Search for : 3
Output: 2 (OK)

Input: 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5
Search for: 3
Output: 4 (this algorithm does not necessarily return the first position in the list due to its interpolation nature)

Input: 3, 2, 1
Output: "Sequence must be sorted to apply interpolation search"

# Feedback

Dear contributor, thanks for your work!
I reviewed your task and the overall quality is good. The prompt is fine, it passes the current quality threshold, but it could be a little more complex or have more constraints.
Your justification was somewhat vague, I improved it by adding test cases and more content to it. Please consider that it is important to test the codes.

Keep up the good work!
