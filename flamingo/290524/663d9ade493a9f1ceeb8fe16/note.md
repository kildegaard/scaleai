Attempter: 

Este flaco hizo cualquier cosa, tenía un prompt que pedía un inventario pero dp el modelo se mandó a hacer una función que no tenía nada que ver con esto.


# Prompts
I am a software developer working for a dairy products distributor. I am developing a system to manage the inventory control of products in the warehouse. I must create a function in Python that indicates which products have an expiration date of less than 5 days. In addition, it must have other functionalities to manage the inventory of the dairy, showing sales, purchases, and inventory changes. Please show these 4 functions in a graphical interface with Tkinter python library.


I want you to add a new tab in the GUI that contains a directory of customers, with an ID, name, address, phone and a ranking by total purchases, being gold, customers with more purchases, silver, intermediate level and bronze customers who buy less. With this information, it creates a statistical model according to the purchases of these customers in the last 2 months and generates discounts based on the prediction of the best gold customers.


According to the directory, it is required to divide the customers by distribution routes, having 5 routes (1 for each dispatcher). Group the customers in the best way taking into account their location.


# Justifs
The both answers are very similar, but the function name of response 2 is better because it is more explicative.


Both are the same.


The both responses are very good, but the first response is better because it uses OOP concepts, creating a re-usable code.

# Feedback

Dear Contributor, this task is very particular. Your prompt talks about doing a GUI about some kind of inventory management, but the Model responses have nothing to do with this topic, at all. Furthermore, you don't notice about this in the justifications. You don't mention a thing about this particular situation, which is very weird.
Consider redoing everything from the first turn and pay attention when Responses do not correlate with your prompt.
