# Prompt

I am a beginner in Python development and I have this code for a Tic Tac Toe. I want you to add inline comments to explain what every method does why every variable is declared for:
```
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

def button_click(btn):
    global current_player

    if btn["text"] == "" and not game_over:
        if current_player == "X":
            btn["text"] = "X"
            current_player = "O"
        else:
            btn["text"] = "O"
            current_player = "X"
        check_winner()

def check_winner():
    global game_over

    for i in range(3):
        if buttons[i][0]["text"] == buttons[i][1]["text"] == buttons[i][2]["text"] != "":
            buttons[i][0].config(bg="green")
            buttons[i][1].config(bg="green")
            buttons[i][2].config(bg="green")
            game_over = True


    for i in range(3):
        if buttons[0][i]["text"] == buttons[1][i]["text"] == buttons[2][i]["text"] != "":
            buttons[0][i].config(bg="green")
            buttons[1][i].config(bg="green")
            buttons[2][i].config(bg="green")
            game_over = True

    if buttons[0][0]["text"] == buttons[1][1]["text"] == buttons[2][2]["text"] != "":
        buttons[0][0].config(bg="green")
        buttons[1][1].config(bg="green")
        buttons[2][2].config(bg="green")
        game_over = True
    if buttons[0][2]["text"] == buttons[1][1]["text"] == buttons[2][0]["text"] != "":
        buttons[0][2].config(bg="green")
        buttons[1][1].config(bg="green")
        buttons[2][0].config(bg="green")
        game_over = True

    if all(buttons[i][j]["text"] != "" for i in range(3) for j in range(3)) and not game_over:
        game_over = True
        messagebox.showinfo("Tic Tac Toe", "It's a draw!")
        reset_game()

    if game_over:
        winner = "O" if current_player == "X" else "X"
        messagebox.showinfo("Tic Tac Toe", f"Player {winner} wins!")
        reset_game()

def reset_game():
    global current_player, game_over
    current_player = "X"
    game_over = False
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            buttons[i][j].config(text="", bg="SystemButtonFace")

app = tk.Tk()
app.title("Tic Tac Toe")

current_player = "X"
game_over = False

buttons = [[tk.Button(app, text="", font="Arial 20", width=5, height=2, command=lambda i=i, j=j: button_click(buttons[i][j])) for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        buttons[i][j].grid(row=i, column=j)

app.mainloop()
```


# Justif modif

Response 1 and Response 2 are very similar between them. Inline comments were generated in both codes and they are all factual and truthful.
Response 1 seems a little more commented than Response 2 so, maybe for someone who is a beginner in Python, this Response would be more useful.
There are no deviations between both responses whatsoever.
Also, both codes compile with no issues at all. I tested them in Visual Studio Code and the worked flawlessly.


# Feedback

Dear Contributor, I reviewed your task and wanted to share some thoughts.

Your prompt is just fine. I would recommend doing it in a more complex way next time. Do not use so common codes like the tic-tac-toe, it is very easily found on the internet and is not complex at all. The idea is to provide good quality and semi-complex prompts to increase the Model's efficiency.

Besides that, the inline comments were good. They are correct and answer the prompt's key items. Both responses were fine and the selection of one over the other was just subjectivity.

Your justification although good lacked some content in it. Yes, both responses were just fine but you must provide some insights about it. Justify why they are the same. Also, comment that you tested the code and that they were fine and without errors. In this new taxonomy tasks it still is important to test the code, please remember that.

Overall, good job!
