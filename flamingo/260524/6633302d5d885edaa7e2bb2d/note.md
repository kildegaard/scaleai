# Prompt

I'm a professor trying to teach my students about higher dimensions. In Python, utilizing visualization libraries, create an interactive animation that illustrates how the 4th dimension can be visualized. It should incorporate the terminology of Charles Howard Hinton, specifically "ana" and "kata".

# Feedback

Dear Attempter, thanks for your work on the project. However, your prompt does not follow actual Guidelines. Its complexity is almost null, there are no constraints, and the context is very vague.
However, despite these things, your justification is very good. You tested your code to analyze what was going on and that's a very encouraging thing to do.
Please, consider increasing the overall complexity and adding more constraints and context to your prompt, the idea is good!
