# Prompt

Farmer Hamoda has inherited a peculiar plot of land. It's riddled with holes, but also dotted with delicious berries! Hamoda wants to build a fence, but not just any fence.
There are two types of animals causing trouble:
The S animal  represented by 's':  This animal can make a small gaps, so any fence section next to a snail hole needs to be double thickness represented by '||'.
The N animal  represented by 'n':   This animal can only jump over one fence section. So, to keep them out, Hamoda needs a fence at least two sections high next to their holes.
Hamoda, being a clever farmer, wants to enclose the largest possible rectangular area with berries inside, while minimizing the cost of building the fence. Different fence sections have varying costs:

Single fence section represented by '|' : 1 coin
Double fence section represented by '||' : 2 coins

Help Hamoda build the most cost-effective  fence by using Python language to enclose the largest rectangular berry patch, avoiding all the animals holes!

Area: 12 squares
Fence Cost: 20 coins

# Justif modif

Response 1 is better than response 2 along the Functionality & Performance dimension, and also along the Reasoning Quality dimension.
Functionality and Performance:
Response 1 using dynamic programming offers better performance for larger grids. It calculates the fence cost in the separate function `calculate_fence_cost` in lines 60–73. it analyzes the `grid` based on the rectangle specified in `rect` and calculates the total cost of building the fence around the rectangle. 
Response 1's output is near the answer of the sample output in the above prompt but not the same However, it's still better than Response 2, where the code raised an error and did not satisfy the prompt requirements. Response 2 is not good for large grids because it checks every possible rectangle within the grid. As the grid size increases, the number of rectangles to check grows, and this will slow the execution time (lines 1–15) compared to Response 1. 

Reasoning Quality: 
Response 1 uses dynamic programming, which is more efficient and clear, but Response 2 uses helper functions for cost and validity checks.

# PRompt 2

I face another two problems, and I will add these features to solve them:
The N animal can now also jump diagonally across one segment of the fences. This has the implication that in order to give protection, Hamoda has to construct a fence of three parts of ‘n’ at least where there is a diagonal pairing of the holes.

Discuss the necessity of adding a new animal type and tentatively call it ‘m’. This animal can go through single barriers but it cannot scale the barriers formed by double barriers. As for the remaining holes of in `m’, Hamoda simply needs to use double fences (||) next to any of these holes and they would be prevented from getting in.

# Feedback

Dear Tasker, very good task overall! Your prompts adjust to the guidelines and your justifications have a very good structure in it. Furthermore, you tested the code, that's a very good practice! Please, keep op the good work!!
