While the idea of your prompt is good, it lacks too many key items for it to be passable, according to actual guidelines. There is almost no context, no constraints, and especially no uniqueness in it. Your follow-up prompt has almost no details in it, is very vague, and needs improvement to achieve the correct quality threshold.
I will share with you the updated documentation so you can support your claims and arguments with it.
Thanks for your time!
