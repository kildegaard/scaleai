# Prompts

Design a Python program using functional programming concepts to implement an AVL tree with advanced features. Include methods for rebalancing, insertion, deletion, and searching. Additionally, implement functionalities for AVL tree rotation, node height calculation, and balancing factor computation. Ensure all operations maintain AVL tree properties.


Oh great! Now, design a Python program using functional programming concepts to implement a function that finds all possible paths between two nodes in a weighted directed graph represented as an adjacency list. The function should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a valid path from the source to the destination node. Ensure the implementation avoids cycles and efficiently explores all possible paths.

Response 2 is better than Response 1 due to functionality and performance its provides a more consise and elegant solution to finding all possible paths between two nodes in a weghted directed graph. It utilizes functional programing concepts such as recursion and lambda functions effectively. Additionally, it explicitly handels cycles avoidance using a visited set, enhancing the robustness of the solution. Response 1, which lacks explicit cycle avoidance logic. 


# Feedback

Dear Contributor, thanks a lot for your efforts in this project.
However, your prompt does not align with actual Guidelines. It is not desired to create prompts that orbit around search algorithms, like this AVL binary search. However, it's a very good idea to use it for further prompts, when you use it as an element of creating a more complex situation, with several constraints and context.
Please, consider redoing the task with these concepts in mind! I will share with you updated documentation for improving the overall performance.
