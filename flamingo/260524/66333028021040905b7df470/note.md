# prompt

Developing a turn-based strategy game in Python where players manage resources (wood, stone, food, gold) to build structures and advance in the game.
Requirements:
Resources: Classes for four types of resources with properties for quantity, production rate, and consumption rate.
Methods to modify the quantity of resources.
Structures: Three types of structures with properties for cost, construction time, and production bonuses.
Methods to build, upgrade, and demolish structures.
Turns: A turn-based system for players to perform actions and update the state of resources and structures.
Victory Conditions: Two victory conditions with methods to check if they are met at the end of each turn.

# justif orig

Response 2 is better than Response 1 in Relevance and Completeness, includes clear definitions and functionality. The code is simpler and more concise, making it easier to understand and follow.
It meets all the essential requirements of the prompt, including resource management, structures, turn-based gameplay, and victory conditions, without overcomplicating the implementation.
By focusing on simplicity, it reduces potential bugs and makes the codebase easier to manage and debug.
Additionally, the code was tested through the Workspace IDE and executed correctly.


# justif modif

le bajo de 7 a 5

Both responses are very similar in their structure. They both execute what the prompt asked, despite being a light version of it. This means that there are functionalities that are present but not able to be used by the user (like methods for modifying the quantity of resources).
Because of this, there are no deviations in this task that follow any dimension in particular. Both codes were tested in VS Code.

# Feedback

Dear contributor, good job with your task! The prompt adjusts to actual guidelines, despite having room for improvements.
Your justification was misplaced due to not being an actual deviation in this case. I modified it from 7 to 5 and updated the justification itself.
You are on a good path for creating excellent prompts. I will share with you some digest of what I am talking about and also the updated documentation so you can get a better idea of what is asked.

Prompts need to have a certain structure considering the following:
- Context: giving some environmental information will buff your prompt as the model has information to be more specific and clever.
- Clear objectives: well-explained goals for the code or problem to achieve.
- Use cases: propose uses for the code to be useful within specific situations
- Constraints: adding extra spice to the model is a good way to increase its quality. Think about specific limitations to take into account or restrictions that would make the problem non-trivial.
- Uniqueness: as stated previously, your problem must provide some fresh ideas to the prompt pool. It's expected for you to write problems that are not so easily found on the internet.
- Complexity: Once again, as stated before, the problem must not be trivial. It would be best if you aimed for issues that require some effort for the model, that provide a clear yet not easy way for solving them.


Another topic to engage in is justifications: in the documentation, there's plenty of information to learn some workflow to tackle this. I'll add them at the end for you to later consults.

Yet another thing that is of extreme importance is to test your code factually (as stated before). Not only test it, but show some evidence that you did, and share the environment set for this. It's important because if the reviewer can not rut it, or if it's too complicated and time-consuming to set the correct environment, then your task is most probably going to be sent back to you. Please consider this!

Keynote for future justifications: I will show you a systematic way of building excellent-quality justifications.

Comparison between responses + Along which dimension? + Epic quality justification + Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code, and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.


With all this, I truly believe you can develop perfect stellar prompts that would make the model thrive to create astonishing responses.

Thanks a lot for reading till the end! I wish you the best on this, I know you have what is needed for the project!
