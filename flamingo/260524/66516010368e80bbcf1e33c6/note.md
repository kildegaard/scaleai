# Prompt

I have the following code below:

```python
import numpy as np

class Solution:
    
    def checkRecord(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        initial_counts = np.array(
            [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
            dtype=np.int64
        )

        adj_matrix = np.array([
            [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
            [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        ], dtype=np.int64)

        def pow(A, exp):
            B = np.identity(len(A), dtype=np.int64)
            for bit in reversed(bin(exp)[2:]):
                if bit == '1':
                    B = B @ A
                    B %= MOD
                A = A @ A
                A %= MOD
            return B

        final_counts = pow(adj_matrix, n) @ initial_counts

        return sum(final_counts) % MOD
```

I have this code in my company's GitHub page and I need help understanding how it functions. It has something to do with marking a student's attendance but I don't have more context than that. Please break down what the code does in sections and the logic of it. Also, wrap the code in proper docstring and comments so I can update the code on my end to make it more clear to everyone. Finally, write a commit message for the updated code. 

# Justif

El flaco marc√≥ que hay deviation pero no. Le bajo de 7 a 5

Response 2 is better than response 1 as it provided more detailed comments and a better commit message

Style & Formatting: Response 1, lines 52-59 contain no comments for the `pow()` function which is bad as the function is not straightforward and can be confusing for someone looking at it for the first time. Also, line 32 does not format the headers that align with the values and can be difficult to read. 

Response 2, lines 63-73 provides proper comments to the `pow()` function that is accurate and helps to understand the function which response 1 does not accomplish. Lines 25-32 create a clear documentation block of all the possible acceptance states that is very easy to read and useful for the reader. Overall, response 2 contained more detailed code and filled in the entire code block unlike response 1.  

# Justif mejorada

Both, response 1 and response 2 are pretty similar. They commented on the code in several steps, explaining how it works and explaining the logic in it. Docstrings were generated in both cases, too.
Because of this, there is no deviation whatsoever between both responses.

# Feedback

Dear Contributor, good work on your attempt!
The prompt was good, according to actual guidelines. However, you marked that there was a deviation where there was not, so I corrected that (from 7 to 5). Both codes do the same and both codes align with the prompt. Subtle differences may arise between them but they attained what was asked.
Thanks for your hard work!
