# Prompt 1

Create a Python program that simulates a space colonization algorithm for procedural generation of alien landscapes. The program should utilize classes and inheritance to model different types of alien flora and fauna, each with unique behaviours and characteristics. Implement a graphical interface using a library like Pygame to display the evolving alien ecosystem in real-time, showing the growth and interaction of various alien species.

# Justif 1 orig

Response 1 separates entities into different classes based on their behaviours and characteristics, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain. Each class defines its update and draw methods, allowing for specific behaviors and rendering for each entity type.
Response 2, on the other hand, defines only two base classes without clear separation. This could lead to more complex code as the program grows and more entity types are added.
Response 1 uses a more consistent and readable naming convention for variables and constants. it also handles the main game loop and event handling more elegantly than response 2.
Both codes achieve similar goals of creatiing a simulation of alien landscapes using Pygame per asked.

Both codes achieve similar goals of creatiing a simulation of alien landscapes using Pygame per asked.
Because of this, there is no apparent deviation in this scenario. Codes were locally tested in a VS Code environment.

# Prompt 2

The program should also include a genetic algorithm to evolve and adapt the alien species over time based on environmental factors.

# Justif 2 orig

Response 1's functionality is robust. It simulates an evolving ecosystem with entities that exhibit realistic behaviours. The implementation of calculation and mutation adds complexity and realism to the simulation. In terms of performance, response 1 is more computationally intensive due to the additional calculations for fitness. Overall, response 1's approach is more sophisticated and realistic and engaging simulation experience.

Response 1 is better than response 2 along the Functionality & Performance dimension.

The implementation of calculation and mutation adds complexity and realism to the simulation. In terms of performance, response 1 is more computationally intensive due to the additional calculations for fitness.

On the other hand, response 2 simply does not run. It generates an AttributeError because the code wants to access an object's attribute that may not have it. This happens in line 113. Not all entities have that attribute, for example, "Plant" or "Tree": they inherit from "Flora" which has no "speed" attribute.

To getting to this conclusion, codes were tested using Visual Studio Code.

# Prompt 3

Enhance the ecosystem simulation program by introducing environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and terrain types. Modify the entities 'behaviours to adapt to these factors, with certain species thriving in specific conditions.

Dear Contributor, good job overall in your task! Your prompts are adequate (yet they could have more detail so the model can adapt better). Your justifications are good as well but there are some things to consider.
You must mention If there is a deviation or not and explain this situation better. Also, when there is a deviation you must explain differences between responses along the correct dimension. You explain many useful details but failed to mention the key ones that differentiate them (response 2 specifically).

Most important thing: you selected the wrong response in prompt 3. You chose Response 1, but Response 2 answered better than the actual prompt. Also, when running the codes, R1 gives a bad approach and very quickly deletes fauna, while in R2 they have a better lifespan.

Consider this minor thing when redoing this task. Thanks a lot for your efforts!
