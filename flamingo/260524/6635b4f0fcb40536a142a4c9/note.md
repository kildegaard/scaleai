# Prompt

My friend has been saving up money for a while because they want to build a new PC. They know I'm knowledgeable in PC building, but I don't want to give them a recommendation because the parts can become outdated quickly. In Python, make a program that gives PC part list recommendations based on up-to-date info from Google about PC building. The program should have a GUI where the user can input a budget, if they're okay with buying secondhand components, and how many recommendations they want to see. The code should be fully commented to ensure that a novice programmer can understand it.
