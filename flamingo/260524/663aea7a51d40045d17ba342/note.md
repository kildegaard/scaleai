# prompt

Develop a Python program that simulates a chemical reaction network. The network consists of multiple chemical species and reactions between them. Each reaction has a rate constant and follows the law of mass action. The simulation should be able to:

Define chemical species and their initial concentrations.
Define reactions, including reactants, products, and rate constants.
Simulate the time evolution of the concentrations of all species using the Euler method for numerical integration.
Handle cases where some reactions are reversible with different rate constants for the forward and backward reactions.
Output the concentrations of all species at specified time intervals.
Consider the following constraints and requirements:

The program should not use any external libraries or APIs.
The input should be given as a structured format (e.g., dictionaries for species and reactions).
Implement checks to ensure the input data is valid (e.g., no negative concentrations or rate constants).
Optimize the code for readability and maintainability with appropriate comments and function documentation.
Describe how you would structure your code to meet these requirements and explain the key functions and algorithms you would use to achieve the simulation.

Reasoning Quality: Response 2 demonstrates a more comprehensive and logical structure by defining three distinct classes (Species, Reaction and ReactionNetwork) and clearly separates the concerns of species definition, reaction definition, and network simulation. This enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.

Relevance & Completeness: Response 2 includes a detailed and methodical approach to handle reversible reactions, validate inputs and manage the simulation process. It also provides a clear example of how to use the defined classes and methods, ensuring the prompt requirements are met thoroughly.

The code in response 2 was tested using the workspace IDE and ran successfully, producing the correct output without any bugs or errrors.

Overall, Response 2 offers a more polished and complete solution that aligns well with the requirements outlined in the prompt.

Response 2 is better than response 1 along the Functionality & Performance dimension because response 1 has an actual bug (NameError) in line 56. It should have imported numpy somewhere along the code but it did not. On the other hand, response 2 worked fine without compilation problems.
Codes were run in VS Code.

# Prompt 2

Now modify the existing chemical reaction network simulation to include the following features:

Dynamic Reaction Addition: Implement a method that allows users to add new reactions to the network while the simulation is running.
Equilibrium Detection: Add a feature that detects when the system has reached equilibrium. Equilibrium is defined as the state when the change in concentrations of all species is below a certain threshold for a specified number of consecutive time steps.
Concentration Plotting: Implement a feature to plot the concentration of each species over time using Python's built-in libraries (e.g., matplotlib). Ensure that the plots are updated dynamically as the simulation progresses.
Please provide a detailed plan on how you would structure and implement these features, along with any necessary code changes or additions. Focus on maintaining the readability and maintainability of the code.

Relevance & Performance: Response 1 provides a detailed and comprehensive implementation for all the requested features, including dynamic reaction addition, equilibrium detection, and concentration plotting. It ensures that every part of the prompt's requirements is addressed thoroughly.
The code in Response 1 was tested and ran successfully using the same Workspace IDE, producing the correct output, such as accurate concentration plots and equilibrium detection, without any bugs or error. It handles the addition of new reactions dynamically, accurately detects equilibrium by monitoring concentration changes, and plots concentration changes over time effectively. This confirms the functionality and reliability of the implementation.

# justif 2 modif

No deviations were found between response 1 and response 2. Despite presenting the code and explanations in a different way, they both achieve the prompt's query.
Both codes execute the code with no main issues.
