# prompts

In Python, there is a dataset that deals with Facial Keypoint Recognition. The dataset itself consists of images and a CSV file with lots of x and y coordinates that correspond to the keypoints on the face. The dataset class FKRDataset contains samples as dictionaries with keys 'image,' 'keypoints,' and 'original_size'. The __init__ method of the FKRDataset class takes in a csv file path and a directory for the images, as well as an optional transform method, which defaults to None. The CSV file has the format: filename, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ... , x14, y14. The __getitem__ method of the FKRDataset should correctly retrieve the image, keypoints, and original size of the image. It should apply the transformation if a transformation has been provided. It should return the sample in the format {'image': image, 'keypoints': keypoints, 'original_size': original_size}. Please create the FKRDataset class.


Using the dataset class, split the dataset using torch.utils.data.random_split into training and validation datasets. Create DataLoaders for each of these datasets. Then, display an image from the training dataset and print the shape.


Using the Dataset class that we defined earlier, let's create a transform function that takes a sample as a parameter. This should not be a class, but rather a function (i.e., ```def transform(sample)```). The function will use the TorchVision Transform library, creating a transformations object with torchvision.transforms.Compose. This transformations object should apply a ColorJitter effect as well, to serve as data augmentation. It should resize the sample to 256x256 pixels. It should convert ToImage, and then ToDtype as well. Finally, it needs to define two variables, original_width and original_height. With these two variables, it will fix the keypoints by calling them with keypoints[:, 0] and keypoints[:, 1] to correctly adjust the values to reflect the resizing. Finally, it should return {'image': image, 'keypoints': keypoints}. It is import that the keypoints returned are converted from numpy and with the proper view as well as casted as float.


# Feedback

Dear contributor. Your prompts' complexity was very good, as well as the context and the constraints. Overall, they are really good indeed. The main issue here is that the code can't be tested without the datasets you suggest in the first prompt. If you are going to create prompts that need external information, you should clearly mention where to obtain them or provide them inside the Sphere Environment (you can attach files there).
I regret to tell you that you will need to redo this task from turn 1 adding this extra (but very important) piece of information.
