# Prompt

Could you help me to develop an application to manage championships? The application should be able to manage contestants, competing classes, the class category, and champion bouts. Here is a more complete specification:
1. the contestant must have an ID, name, age, height, country, and class they are participating
2. the class must have ID, name, category
3. bout records, containing contestant, who is the winner, and the score
4. bout schema manager which pairs contestants for the bout, this should be done automatically once all the data has been inputted.
5. allow me to input data for class category, country, contestant
6. allow me to generate the bout schema for all competing class
7. allow me to input the score for each bout
8. allow me to complete the championship only if all bouts have been inputted with scores and the winner.
9. Provide me a summary of the competition by providing winners (from 1 to 4)  for all competing classes.
10. Provide me a report of all competing countries, and their gold, silver, and bronze. 
11. Every class will have one gold winner (number 1), silver winner (number 2), and bronze winner (3 and 4)
Please also add additional specifications that I may have missed to be able completely manage the championship completely. Could you help? 

# justif original

Response 1 is better because it provides a complete user interface that allows interaction with the application, fulfilling the prompt requirements. In contrast, Response 2 only prints the result and exits, which does not meet the prompts criteria. Therefore Response 1 is better from the Relevance and Completeness dimension. 

Functionality and performance:  Run Response 1 locally, and it gives a console interface that matches the prompt criteria such as add country, add class category, add competing class, add contestant, Generate bouts, Input Score, Complete championship, Get winners, and Get medal count (Lines 105-167), and Line 164 indicating it only exit the application if '10' is inputted. Response 2 also ran without errors but did not meet the prompt requirements as it exited directly after printing the result.

Response 1 and Response 2 fully answer the prompt in similar ways. Therefore, there's no deviation in this case.
Both codes assess each of the prompt's requirements (though lightly and with no further details). They handle the additional features for championship management poorly, but maybe that was expected due to the lack of details given.
Also, both codes were tested in a local VS Code environment.

Dear Contributor, thanks for your efforts in this project!
I reviewed your task and it was very good :) The prompt aligns with the actual guidelines in relation to context, constraints, and usefulness. Though its complexity is not super high, it's acceptable to add many normal steps to create a multi-level prompt. 
Your justification and ranking between responses had some issues that I corrected. No deviation was found between both responses, as they accomplished what was asked and ran without problems in my local IDE. So, I changed the ranking and edited the justification accordingly.
