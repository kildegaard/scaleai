# PRompt

I have ADHD and have many issues with maintaining focus on a given task. I want to create a tool that will help out with tracking my tasks, medication, and time. Create a program in Python that is a combination of a to-do list, pomodoro timer, and medication tracker. The user should be able to see all three of these items on some type of GUI. The pomodoro timer should also have some type of progress bar animation that changes color as it's going down. The program should also allow the user to export their to-do list as a text file, and the code should be commented.

# Feedback

I have reviewed your task and found that your prompt has already been widely used across many attempters. Despite not being the exact same situation, it's a very common idea that is very easily found on the internet, with more or less details.
The main idea of the project is to present complex and innovative prompts to the model to make it work to its fullest. This is not possible with common or repetitive prompts.
Please consider modifying your prompt's idea to something with more originality in its concept and that follows the guidelines. I'll attach the documentation for this!
