# Original Justification

After testing the two responses on my local device, I found that Response 1 is better than Response 2 along the Functionality & Performance dimension. 
Response 1 is better in functionality and performance because the program creates a 6x6 grid of gray squares with one red square. When the user clicks on a square, it checks if the clicked square is red or not; if it is, it increases the score and then generates a new grid with a different location for the red square. The game lasts for 90 seconds, and at the end, it displays the final score.
Response 2 creates a 6x6 grid of blue squares; however, the code does not give the same functionality set by the user. For example, the code does not stick to one red square, it instead displays several red squares at the same time. Other times, it does not give red squares at all, the timer keeps running until the turn is done with no red squares to click.
The two codes were tested locally using VS Code. Response 1 needs 2 files: index.html and script.ts. Response 2 needs one file called index.html.

# Modified justification

Response 2 is better than response 2 along the "Relevance & Completeness" dimension. They also differ along the "Functionality & Performance" dimension a secondary.

Relevance & Completeness:
Response 1 truly follows all prompt instructions and addresses all of its requirements. On the other hand, response 2 fails to do so. The prompt says "The user needs to select the unique box and click on it as quickly as possible" but R2 gives more than one red box at the same time (sometimes even non red squares are displayed).

Functionality & Performance:

Both responses compile without issues, but response 1 generates the expected results and outputs, whereas response 2 does not.

# Feedback

Hello dear Tasker! Very good job with your work. I will show you some things that I saw in your prompt and in your justifications so you can better improve for the next attempts, but the overall quality is nice!

# Prompt writing

According to our updated Guidelines, there are several important factors to consider Prompt as a "Stellar Prompt":
- Context: you provided some context for the attempt. Maybe I would have developed this further, but it's OK from my perspective.
- Well-defined Objective: it's very clear. You want to create a game with certain features and display it accordingly.
- Uniqueness: I don't believe it's an innovative idea. It looks more like a program done when first learning HTML/JS. Despite this, it's also not AI-generated nor blatantly copied right from the internet.
- Complexity: mid-level from my POV. It could have been more complex, adding more steps, more GUI information, or interaction with the user.
- Testable: 10/10 using VS Code with Live Server.
- Useful IRL: Nice game. Good for educational purposes and could work for a webpage of quick games.
- No AI-Text: OK.
- Misc: -

# Justification Issues

In order for your justifications to be good, they must have the following syntax:
    [1] Comparison between responses + [2] Along which dimension? + [3] Epic quality justification + [4] Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code [5], and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.

In your specific situation, all these steps are present, so that's very nice!

I Modified the chosen dimension from "Functionality & Performance" to "Relevance & Completeness", as the latter has more priority within dimensions. I also added an explanation for it, and conserved the one you wrote which was very good!

With all this being said, I liked your task. Please, for the next ones consider following the recommendations given to better improve the attempt's quality.
I will share with you some documentation that may come in handy to better assess this.

Thanks a lot for reading till the end! I wish you the best on this, I know you have what is needed for the project!
