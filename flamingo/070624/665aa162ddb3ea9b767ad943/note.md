I want to create a game using **Python**. 

At the beginning, there is a "Start" button. When clicked, the player starts the game.

When the game starts, a red and blue square appears at the bottom of the screen.

There are two types of circles: red and blue. When you click on the red square, the red circles must move to the red square. Similarly, when you click on the blue square, the blue circles must move to the blue square.

Response 2 is much better than Response 1 in terms of relevance and completeness.
- In Response 1, When running the game, there isn't a "start" button initially, but in Response 2, it is.
- In Response 1, the two squares don't have space between them, but in Response 2, there is space between the squares.
- In Response 1, when clicking the blue or red square, many circles start moving downwards from the top. But in Response 2, when clicking on the red square, all red circles move to the red square, and when clicking on the blue square, all blue circles move to the blue square.
In conclusion, Response 2 is much better than Response 1.
Both codes were locally tested in VS Code with no issues, I only had to install `pygame` and they ran flawlessly.
