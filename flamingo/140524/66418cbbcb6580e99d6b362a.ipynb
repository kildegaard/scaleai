    "Vancomycin is a drug used to treat bacteria in cases where it is resistant to other medications. I need you to create a JavaScript program that calculates the doses of vancomycin for an array of patient objects following these instructions:\n",
    "1. Accept the patient array; each object has (patient name, age, gender, weight, serum creatinine, and height).\n",
    "2. It must calculate creatinine clearance (CrCl) and assign it to the patient's object using a suitable formula for the patient's age.\n",
    "3. Vancomycin doses must be calculated using these rules:\n",
    "\t- **Adults**\n",
    "Loading Dose (mg) = Weight (kg)×20 to 25 mg/kg\n",
    "Maintenance Dose (mg) = Weight (kg)×15 to 20 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours.\n",
    "\t- **Children**\n",
    "Maintenance & Loading Dose (mg/kg) = 15 to 20 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours.\n",
    "\t- **Regarding CrCL**\n",
    "\t\t- (30-50mL/min) given every 12–24 hours.\n",
    "\t\t- (10-30mL/min) given every 24-28 hours.\n",
    "\t\t- ( <10mL/min) given after dialysis for adults; don't give in children's cases.\n",
    "- In a CSV, save all the new objects as columns, each containing their accurate doses. If a patient isn't eligible for Vancomycin, then this should be mentioned as a string \"Mismatch\"."
