# Prompt

Create for me a Python program to make a basic GUI text editor.

Functionality requirements:

1. The script will be used in the terminal to point to a file in the local system in which it will open the files contents in the GUI.

2. The GUI will feature a text area component in which the contents are displayed, I should be able to type in the text area and revise the contents as needed. 

3. There should be a save button in the GUI which will write the displayed contents to the file.
