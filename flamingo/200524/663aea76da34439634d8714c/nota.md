# Prompt

I'm studying how Node JS handles async programming with large chunks of data within an HTTP server. Write an application that makes use of the worker thread native library to process the data and write to MongoDB without affecting the main thread where the server is running. For now, consider using a single endpoint to receive an e-mail and name to store on the users' collection.

# Original justification

Response 1 is better than response 2:
- Relevance & Completeness: even though both responses are satisfactory, response 2 uses the Mongoose library which makes handling data easier because it acts as both a validation and data layer for the application, whereas response 1 uses the driver directly and does not account for data validation before writing to MongoDB.
- Functionality & Performance: response 2 makes use of async / await syntax which response 1 lacks and keeps using a callback-based approach.

I have manually tested the code on my machine, and it works as expected, dispatching new workers when necessary and avoiding blocking the main thread.


# Modificada

Response 1 is slightly better than response 2, but this difference is not so big as to claim for any deviations in this case.

Despite this, they differ in some important things (not considered in the prompt).

# Feedback

Hello, dear Tasker! Good job on your attempt. I consider your prompt adequate as per actual guidelines.
I consider that, in relation to the prompt, there are no deviations and modified that accordingly. Also, changed the justification to adhere to this modification.

Note: in your justification, you confused Response 1 with Response 2. This was a minor thing because it was obvious when reading your text: I just swapped 1 with 2 and everything worked fine.

Thanks for your efforts, keep up the good work!
