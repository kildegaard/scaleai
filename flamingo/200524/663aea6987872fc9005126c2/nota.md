Hello there. I've reviewed your attempt and have some things to discuss.
I will split my feedback in two: first I will explain to you what issues I found concerning the prompt, and then about the justification.

# Prompt writing

According to our updated Guidelines, there are several important factors to consider Prompt as a "Stellar Prompt":
- Context: There's some context given, but in your case, it's more like a story-telling prompt. This is not encouraged. You should give context but within reason. You must not forget that it's an LLM and do not feed it with too much unnecessary information.
- Well-defined Objective: No objective at all. This prompt has no reason for being: there is nothing stated for the model to do at any point.
- Uniqueness: Not at all.
- Complexity: Really low. States nothing to do.
- Testable: -
- Useful IRL: -
- No AI-Text: It seems AI-generated due to many issues along the text.
- Misc: -

This prompt is not very good for this project, please consider redoing it and reading the Crash Course Documentation.

# Justification Issues

In order for your justifications to be good, they must have the following syntax:
    [1] Comparison between responses + [2] Along which dimension? + [3] Epic quality justification + [4] Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code [5], and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.

In your specific situation, you solved [1, 3] with a medium level, but yet have to analyze all the other conditions mentioned before.

With all this being said, please redo the task and follow the instructions to improve the attempt's quality to the project's required level.
I will share with you some documentation that may come in handy to better assess this.

Thanks a lot for reading till the end! I wish you the best on this, I know you have what is needed for the project!
