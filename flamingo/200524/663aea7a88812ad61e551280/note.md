# Prompt

I'm exploring JavaScript's animation capabilities and want to create a circle dance animation using a `p5.js` library. Here are the adjusted steps for completing the task:

- Create an immersive animation environment that supports multiple canvases with layered animations. Introduce advanced rendering techniques like shaders.
- Develop a sophisticated user interface (UI) allowing users to customize a wide range of dancer attributes, including color gradients, texture mapping, animation blending modes, and real-time shader parameters.
- Use advanced input methods such as touch gestures or voice commands for intuitive interaction.
- Enable an interactive performance mode where users can interact with the dancers in real-time, influencing their movements through gestures, and keyboard input. 
- Implement collaborative features allowing multiple users to join the performance remotely and synchronize their actions across devices.
-   introduce realistic physics-based interactions between dancers and their environment using Box2D.
- Explain in detail, step by step, and write a conclusion.

# Justificacion modificada

Response 1 is better than Response 2 along the "Relevance & Completeness" and "Functionality & Performance" dimensions.

Relevance & Completeness:
Response 1 uses shaders along the code, whereas response 2 does not.

Functionality and Performance:
Response 1 provided code without errors and demonstrated the correct usage of `p5.js` functions and features
Response 2, on the other hand, contains a critical error in the code related to the `webSpeechRecognition`, and this oversight impacts the functionality of the code and renders it unusable.

Code was locally tested in a local environment, where these issues were noticed.

# Feedback

Good prompt! I corrected your task and found your prompt very interesting. Your justification was good, too, but lacked certain important aspects that I will mention below. Overall, you did a great job!

Prompts need to have a certain structure considering the following:
- Context: giving some environmental information will buff your prompt as the model has information to be more specific and clever.
- Clear objectives: well-explained goals for the code or problem to achieve.
- Use cases: propose uses for the code to be useful within specific situations
- Constraints: adding extra spice to the model is a good way to increase its quality. Think about specific limitations to take into account or restrictions that would make the problem non-trivial.
- Uniqueness: as stated previously, your problem must provide some fresh ideas to the prompt pool. It's expected for you to write problems that are not so easily found on the internet.
- Complexity: Once again, as stated before, the problem must not be trivial. It would be best if you aimed for issues that require some effort for the model, that provide a clear yet not easy way for solving them.

Another topic to engage in is justifications: in the documentation, there's plenty of information to learn some workflow to tackle this. I'll add them at the end for you to later consults.
Your justification also lacks development in it. Some things can be done to improve it further. For example, it is important to show evidence in the responses to support your response selection. You must also claim where's the deviation (in case there is), or analyze why there is not.

Another thing that is of extreme importance is to test your code factually (as stated before). Not only test it, but show some evidence that you did, and share the environment set for this. It's important because if the reviewer can not rut it, or if it's too complicated and time-consuming to set the correct environment, then your task is most probably going to be sent back to you. Please consider this!

Keynote for future justifications: I will show you a systematic way of building excellent-quality justifications.

Comparison between responses + Along which dimension? + Epic quality justification + Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code, and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.


With all this, I truly believe you can develop perfect stellar prompts that would make the model thrive to create astonishing responses.

Thanks a lot for reading till the end! I wish you the best on this, I know you have what is needed for the project!
