# Prompt

I have been allocated the development of a more improved botanical garden management system as part of my job to simplify the arrangement and handling of plant data.

Create JavaScript functions that allow users to do the following:

1. Add Plant: It allows users to add a new plant into the system where one is required to fill in the name, country of origin, and care instructions.
2. Searching for Plant: The function allows the users to access plants by typing their name.
3. Delete a Plant: Any plant entry must be removable from the system by its user.
4. Update Plant's Details: Details like care instructions and origin may be altered by plant owners.

Utilize tree-based algorithms such as binary search trees or B-trees to efficiently organize and manage plant data, optimizing search and retrieval operations.

To ensure system stability and reliability, gracefully handle potential issues like invalid input or database errors by implementing robust error-handling mechanisms.

# Justification

Response 1 excels over Response 2 in relevance and completeness by leveraging tree-based algorithms like binary search trees, ensuring efficient data organization. It comprehensively implements all specified features, including error handling for system stability. Conversely, Response 2 lacks adherence to the specific requirements, as it neglects the utilization of tree structures, leading to compromised scalability and search optimization.
In conclusion, Response 1 is better than Response 2.

# Justi mejorada

Response 1 is better than Response 2 along the "Relevance & Completeness" dimension.
This is done by leveraging tree-based algorithms like binary search trees, ensuring efficient data organization. It implements all specified features, including error handling for system stability.
On the other hand, Response 2 does not completely follow the specific requirements, as it neglects the utilization of tree structures, leading to compromised scalability and search optimization.
These codes were locally tested and both compiled without any errors.


# Feedback

Good job with your task! I corrected minor (but important) things in your attempt, but the overall quality is very good.

To better improve your quality and get higher qualifications, you can assess the following guides:

Prompts need to have a certain structure considering the following:
- Context: giving some environmental information will buff your prompt as the model has information to be more specific and clever.
- Clear objectives: well-explained goals for the code or problem to achieve.
- Use cases: propose uses for the code to be useful within specific situations
- Constraints: adding extra spice to the model is a good way to increase its quality. Think about specific limitations to take into account or restrictions that would make the problem non-trivial.
- Uniqueness: as stated previously, your problem must provide some fresh ideas to the prompt pool. It's expected for you to write problems that are not so easily found on the internet.
- Complexity: Once again, as stated before, the problem must not be trivial. It would be best if you aimed for issues that require some effort for the model, that provide a clear yet not easy way for solving them.

Another topic to engage in is justifications: in the documentation, there's plenty of information to learn some workflow to tackle this. I'll add them at the end for you to later consults.
Your justification also lacks development in it. Some things can be done to improve it further. For example, it is important to show evidence in the responses to support your response selection. You must also claim where's the deviation (in case there is), or analyze why there is not.

Another thing that is of extreme importance is to test your code factually (as stated before). Not only test it, but show some evidence that you did, and share the environment set for this. It's important because if the reviewer can not rut it, or if it's too complicated and time-consuming to set the correct environment, then your task is most probably going to be sent back to you. Please consider this!

Keynote for future justifications: I will show you a systematic way of building excellent-quality justifications.

Comparison between responses + Along which dimension? + Epic quality justification + Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code, and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.


With all this, I truly believe you can develop perfect stellar prompts that would make the model thrive to create astonishing responses.

Thanks a lot for reading till the end! I wish you the best on this, I know you have what is needed for the project!
