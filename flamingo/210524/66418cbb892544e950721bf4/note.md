# Prompt
Can you make a GUI for a budget tracker app using Python.
This GUI allows users to:
Enter their income and expenses, add a note for expenses like food for KFC, and save the time and date with the format DD-MM-YY.
Calculates the total budget when the button 'Calculate' is clicked.
Add a button to view the transaction history, and a button to clear the transaction history.
Clicking this button clears the listbox and displays transaction history from the file 'transactions.txt'.
Displays transaction history with details such as income, expenses, and notes.
Saves each transaction's income, expense, and total to the file 'transactions.txt' for record-keeping.
The Reset button clears the entry fields.
Ability to categorize transactions like food, repair, etc, by the button 'Categorize'.
Visualize budget data using plot charts in the Matplotlib library, when you click the button 'Chart'.


# Justif orig
Response 1 is better than response 2 in functionality and performance.
Response 1 generates GUI follows instructions but 'Categorize' button doesn't work.
Response 2 generates GUI, the history is unclear because the space is too small.
Button 'Categorize', 'Chart' and 'View history' are not working.
Both responses should make history displays when user clicks View history button.
(I tested codes locally).
