# Prompt

Write a program called word_pattern(), that given a input <pattern> which is an all lowercase string and a word list of strings, <words>, determine if the word list follows the same pattern. That is ensure that pattern[j] == pattern[k] only when words[j] == words[k] and pattern[j] != pattern[k] only when words[j] != words[k]. For example, word_pattern('aaaa', ['cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'cat']) should return True. The function should return a boolean.
