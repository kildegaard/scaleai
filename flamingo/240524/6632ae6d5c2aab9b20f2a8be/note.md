Dear Contributor. Your prompts were very good, especially the first one. I like the idea and, despite having some issues, it was good overall.
The main problem is that, from what I can see, you did not test the code.
If the codes had been tested, you would have selected Response 2 as the correct one, as it is the one that accurately answers the combinatorics with no issues. Response 1 simplifies the problem in such a way that it does not assess the prompt's constraints of distinct value assignments across multiple slots.
In fact, when you test them, for example with the following values:
1
10 5 3
The correct combinatoric answer is 2177280. Response 2 gets this exact number, whereas Response 1 gets 6, a clear mistake.
I tested all this in IntelliJ IDEA using JDK 22.

Please, consider that it's very important to test the code in order to train the model with the correct answers.
Redo this task changing the response and correctly testing it.

Thanks a lot for your time!!
