# Prompt

Working inside a car dealership, I'm creating a project to make an HTML page for us to display our new car models. I have already created the HTML for it, but I want to implement a carousel effect for the images. This is my current JavaScript function, but it seems to not be working; images keep overlapping.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () = > {
   const images = document.querySelectorAll('.newcar');
   let count= 0;    
function Carousel() {
        images[count].style.display = 'block';
        count = count + 1;
        images[count].style.display = 'block';
    }
   const interval = 3000; 
    setInterval(Carousel, interval);
});

I would like you to fix the code and implement navigation buttons (left and right) for the user to change the current image. Please include a function visual representation on where we are inside of the carousel, testing different cases where the dots are more than the actual screen size. This carousel needs to adjust to different screen sizes.

Response 2 is better than Response 1 because it handles the edge case of having too many images to fit in the screen. The prompt mentioned adjusting the dots only, and both responses handle that scenario, but Response 2 went a step ahead and prevented the carousel to overflow with images.

Functionality & Performance: Response 2, in line 41, implements a function called "adjustCarousel". This function fixed the edge case of having too many images to fit the screen of the device displaying it. This is best for adaptability to different devices.

I tested the code to verify this information. Both solutions compiled.

Because of this, there is a clear deviation along the Functionality & Performance dimension which makes Response 2 better than Response 1.

Codes were locally tested in Visual Studio Code implementing Live Server extension.
For running the codes I created artificial HTML and CSS files to test the actual JavaScript files in them. Also, I used internet-downloaded images to test the carousel.

# Feedback

Dear Contributor, good work on your task! Your prompt was very good, as was your justification. Your prompt however could have been more detailed around the HTML where you will finally see the carousel, that way you provide a better explanation for reviewers. Also, your justification lacked more information on how you tested the codes. This is very important to understand if the Model hallucinated or not because there are usually small details that can only be seen trough testing the codes.
Good job overall, keep it up!
