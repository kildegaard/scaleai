Excellent job, dear Tasker! Prompt & justification have no problems at all. They adjust to actual guidelines with no issues whatsoever.
The only suggestion I would make is to add more details to the prompt when talking about the bug. Something interesting would be to write an input and and expected output, so then you can compare with the corrected version.
