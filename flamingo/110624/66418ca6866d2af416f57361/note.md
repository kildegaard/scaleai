Response 2 is better than response 1 because it create separate classes for department, floor and office building to handle prompt and includes an example usage to test that the code. Specifically, lines 1-46  in response 2 defines the classes, and the example usage in lines 49-59 demonstrates that the code returns a correct output. When tested, response 2's code successfully ran and produced the expected output the arrangement of staff across the floors. Response 1's code returned a runtime error due to TypeError on line 23, which occurred because  it could not read properties on an undefined function. 

In summary, response 2 is better because it uses separate classes for better organisation and includes a working example, while response 1 has a runtime error.
