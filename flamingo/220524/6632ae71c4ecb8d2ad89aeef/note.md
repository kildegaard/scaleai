# Prompt

I am working on a Django application that requires processing datasets asynchronously after they are uploaded via an API endpoint. To achieve this, I have integrated Celery to handle background tasks and Sentry for error tracking. Write the necessary code for the views.py file that includes logging configuration, optional Sentry integration for error tracking, and the definition of a Celery task to process the dataset asynchronously. The solution should involve actual file handling using Django's default storage. The sample API view should handle the dataset upload, save the file to default storage, trigger the Celery task to process the file asynchronously, and return appropriate responses based on the task's execution.

The second response is better than the first response because the relevance and completeness.  
Response 2 is alines with the prompt's requirements for handling actual file using Django default storage. 
in Response 1 the Celery task process_dataset primarily logs messages and simulates dataset processing using a sleep function 'time.sleep(5)' at (line 25). It dose not involve actual file handling.

I was tested the code on the local machine by integrate it with a Django project then upload a file via API endpoint and check if the Celery task is triggered and processes the file correctly.
