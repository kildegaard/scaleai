# prompt

I am working on an application for a small ecommerce suite, focusing on used books as the product. I primarily work in Python. The current stock of books for sale is stored in a graph represented by a Python 2D Array. I want to rearrange the array to group by duplicates. Assume there is a large number of duplicates, and this operation must be done efficiently. Please present commented Python code for the above task.

# justif orig

Response 1 is better than Response 2 due to its higher relevance to the prompt, and more cleanly documented code. 

Test Results: The code in both responses were tested, and both ran in similar time with identical output. Both functions successfully group the input matrix and print the output. Each test was run using the testing code presented in the respective Response, as this was the most relevant test case. 

Relevance & Completeness: Response 1 takes an input 2D array, and returns an output 2D array at line 34. Response 2 returns a 3D array at line 19, by returning a dictionary's list of values.  Response 1 is better relevant to the prompt because a 3D array was never mentioned, and I demanded an efficient operation on a 2D array. Response 1 features detailed single-line comments at each step, as well as a large comment block at lines 2-10 describing the input and output of the function. Response 2 has no such block comment at Line 2, only single-line comments. This makes Response 1 more relevant to my request of commented code. Therefore, Response 1 is better due to its adherence to the prompt and superior documentation.

Very good job, dear Contributor! Your prompt is very good indeed, as well as your justification. They adhere pretty well to Guideline standards. Well done!
