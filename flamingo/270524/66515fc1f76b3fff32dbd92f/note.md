# Prompt

There is a special box in Numeria village with 'n' magic stones, each having different numbers. Every day, the wise elder man keeps watch over these stones. People from the town come with 'q' queries. Some want to strengthen the gems by increasing the value of each number between 'a' and 'b' by adding a number 'u', while others want to know the number on a single stone at position k. The wise older man assists all of them in maintaining peace within his village and keeping the stones balanced.

```Python
def build_tree(l, r, idx, nums, tree):
    if l == r:
        return nums[l]
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    left = build_tree(l, mid, 2 * idx + 1, nums, tree)
    right = build_tree(mid + 1, r, 2 * idx + 2, nums, tree)
    tree[idx] = left + right
    return tree[idx]

def get_sum(l, r, idx, tree, lazy, a, b):
    if lazy[idx] == 0:
        tree[idx] += (b - a + 1) * lazy[idx]
        if l != r:
            lazy[2 * idx + 1] += lazy[idx]
            lazy[2 * idx + 2] += lazy[idx]
    if a <= l and r <= b:
        return tree[idx]
    if b < l or a > r:
        return 0
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    left = get_sum(l, mid, 2 * idx + 1, tree, lazy, a, b)
    right = get_sum(mid + 1, r, 2 * idx + 2, tree, lazy, a, b)
    return left + right

def update_tree(l, r, idx, tree, lazy, a, b, u):
    if lazy[idx] == 0:
        tree[idx] += (b - a + 1) * lazy[idx]
        if l != r:
            lazy[2 * idx + 1] += lazy[idx]
            lazy[2 * idx + 2] += lazy[idx]
    if b < l or a > r:
        return
    if a <= l and r <= b:
        tree[idx] += (b - a + 1) * u
        if l != r:
            lazy[2 * idx + 1] += u
            lazy[2 * idx + 2] += u
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    update_tree(l, mid, 2 * idx + 1, tree, lazy, a, b, u)
    update_tree(mid + 1, r, 2 * idx + 2, tree, lazy, a, b, u)
    tree[idx] = tree[2 * idx + 1] + tree[2 * idx + 2]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, q = 8, 3
    nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 1, 5, 3]
    tree = [0] * (n * 4)
    lazy = [0] * (n * 4)
    build_tree(0, n - 1, 0, nums, tree)
    
    queries = [(2, 4), (1, 2, 5, 1), (2, 4)]
    for query in queries:
        op = query[0]
        if op == 1:
            a, b, u = query[1:]
            update_tree(0, n - 1, 0, tree, lazy, a - 1, b - 1, u)
        elif op == 2:
            k = query[1]
            sum = get_sum(0, n - 1, 0, tree, lazy, k - 1, k - 1)
            print(sum)
```

I tried implementing a segment tree to solve the question, but I'm getting some errors. Help me debug the code and fix the errors.


# Justif

Tested both the codes in the workspace IDE using the test case given in the codes. All the libraries are already installed, I just ran the code by pressing the 'Run' button on the IDE. 
Response 2 is better than Response 1 in terms of Functionality & Performance.
Response 1 leads to an `IndexError: list index out of range` due to incorrect bounds checking and incorrect handling of lazy propagation.
Response 2 works without errors and produces the correct output (5 6).

Detailed Comparison:
1. In Response 1, the `build_tree` function does not assign the value to `tree[idx]` when `l==r`. In Response 2, the correct code line `tree[idx]=nums[l]` is added when `l==r`, ensuring the leaf nodes are properly initialized (refer to code line 3). 

2. In Response 1, the `update_tree` function does not include a return statement after applying updates to a fully covered segment, leading to unnecessary recursive calls. In Response 2, the `update_tree` function includes a return statement after updating a fully covered segment `if a<=l and r<=b:` (refer to code line 41).
