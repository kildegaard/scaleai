# justif original

Reponse 2 is better than Response 1 because of Relevance and Completeness. In my prompt I asked to document the code. It means I need only the documentation for the code, like text. Response 1 does provide documentation but it is within the code. In contrast Response 2 provides a really clear documentation for the code which is easier to read and understand.
Overall, Response 2 is better because it provides the documentation in proper way.

le baj√© de 7 a 5

Response 2 is hardly better than response 1. Both responses answer the prompt equally but in different forms: Response 1 does this with inline comments, while Response 2 does this in a readme format.
Because of this, there is no apparent deviation between both responses.

# Feedback

Good job on your task! The prompt is very good, it is just about documenting the code. The justification you wrote said that there was a deviation, but according to my understanding, there is not. Both ways of documenting are correct: inline and readme.
So, I changed the rating and modified the justification accordingly.
Overall quality is very good, thanks a lot for your commitment to the project!
