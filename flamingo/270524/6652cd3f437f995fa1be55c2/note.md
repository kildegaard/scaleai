Uso web scrapping, patr√°s

# Feedback

Dear Contributor, thanks a lot for your time invested in this project.
According to actual Guidelines and consensus, it is not allowed to generate prompts regarding web scrapping, so anything that is related to that can't be approved, unfortunately.
Because of this, I regret to inform you to redo this task using other concepts as its core. Also, web crawlers are not allowed either, so keep that in mind.

Your justifications were very good, though there is room for improvement. Keynote for future justifications: I will show you a systematic way of building excellent-quality justifications.

Comparison between responses + Along which dimension? + Epic quality justification + Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code, and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.
