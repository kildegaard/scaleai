# prompts

Design a Python program using functional programming concepts to implement an AVL tree with advanced features. Include methods for rebalancing, insertion, deletion, and searching. Additionally, implement functionalities for AVL tree rotation, node height calculation, and balancing factor computation. Ensure all operations maintain AVL tree properties.


Thank you for giving a good response! Now, how can you enhance the AVL tree implementation to efficiently support operations like finding the k most frequent items or locating all items with frequencies exceeding a given threshold, while preserving AVL tree properties?


# justifs

Response 2 is better than Response 1 because it provides a more complete Style and Formatting explanation of the AVL tree implementation. The code is well-structured, with clear headings and proper formatting. Response 2 includes examples of tree insertion, deletion, and searching, along with pre-order traversal outputs, demonstrating the functionality of AVL tree. In contrast, while Response 1 provides code for an AVL tree,it lacks proper formatitng,comments, and explanations, making it harder to understand and utilize. Overall, Response 2 offers a more comprehensive and readable explanation of AVL tree implementation in Python.


Response 2 is slightly better than Response 1 because Response 2's approach of directly updating frequencies during insertion might scale better for larger datasets, as it avoids additional sorting operations and its provides more flexibility in terms of extending the implementation for different use cses or adding further optimizations. Efficiency of Response 2 might have a slight edge as it avoids shorting for finding k most frequent items. Both responses are effective response, Response 2 might be considered slightly better due to its efficiency and scalability advantages.

# feedback

Dear Contributor. I remember this task because I reviewed it yesterday. I wrote you this review:

"
Dear Contributor, thanks a lot for your efforts in this project.
However, your prompt does not align with actual Guidelines. It is not desired to create prompts that orbit around search algorithms, like this AVL binary search. However, it's a very good idea to use it for further prompts, when you use it as an element of creating a more complex situation, with several constraints and context.
Please, consider redoing the task with these concepts in mind!
"

From what I can see, you did not modify the prompt, it's exactly the same (you did recreate the responses and justifications and the follow-up prompt, though).
Without changing your first prompt, the task is not going to pass the minimum quality threshold.

Another important thing is that you considered a deviation in the first justification along the formatting dimension. This is not the case: rarely formatting causes a differentiation between responses capable of being considered a deviation. Please, read the documentation as this suggests to me you need to refresh some key ideas.
