# prompt

Hey, I am currently working on an online bookstore website. My friend helped me write a Python script regarding book recommendations, but I'm not sure what it currently does. Could you comment the code and also provide an easy-to-understand description for a non-coder?
```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, id, title, author, popularity):
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.popularity = popularity

class RecommendationSystem:
    def __init__(self, books = []):
        self.recommendations = books

    def add_book(self, book):
        for recommendation in self.recommendations:
            if (book.id == recommendation.id):
                print(f'{book.title} could not be added, there is already a registered book with id {book.id}')
                return

        self.recommendations.append(book)

    def get_recommendations(self):
        return sorted(self.recommendations, key=lambda x: x.popularity, reverse=True)

recommendation_system = RecommendationSystem()
recommendation_system.add_book(Book(14, "The Dog in the Scarf", "Harry Barker", 39))
recommendation_system.add_book(Book(18, "43 Aquarium Street", "Sally Fisher", 70))
recommendation_system.add_book(Book(20, "A New Age", "John Newman", 62))
recommendation_system.add_book(Book(14, "Cactus and the Fruit", "Steven Butler", 14))

recommendations = recommendation_system.get_recommendations()
for recommendation in recommendations:
    print(f'{recommendation.title}, {recommendation.author} - Recommended by {recommendation.popularity}%')
```

# justif 1 orig

Response 1 is better than Response 2 because it includes thorough comments that make the code understandable to someone who doesn't code, whereas Response 2 provided less detailed comments. This can be seen by comparing lines 20-30 of Response 1 with lines 16-21 of Response 2, this adheres to the criteria of being "easy-to-understand for a non-coder".

Both responses successfully identified that the goal of the system was to sort book recommendations by popularity. They also both noted that the system does not accept multiple books with the same id. Additionally, both responses were successfully tested.

Response 1 is slightly better than response 2 because, despite not being a clear deviation between them, comment generation is done more meaningfully. They make the code more understandable to someone who does not code. This adheres to the "easy-to-understand description for a non-coder" section of the prompt.

Well done, dear Contributor! Your prompts are very good indeed, as well as your justifications! I only modified the first one because there was no deviation between responses: I adjusted that justification accordingly.
It's nice to review such good attempts, thanks for your time!
