# Justif 1

Both responses are similar; however, response 2 adds more details to the argument's default values and uses more concise wording.


# Justif 1 mejorada

Both responses are similar; however, response 2 adds more details to the argument's default values and uses more concise wording. There are no factual deviations between Response 1 and Response 2 because of their similarity.

# Prompt 2
Add inline comments to describe each step in details, and modify the cost function to be the root mean squared error instead.


# Justif 2

Response 2 is slightly better than response 1 because it provides more detailed comments than response 1 and generates more spaces, which makes the code more readable than response 1. Again, no deviation was found in this step between response 1 and response 2. Both responses answered the prompt as it was asked by the user.

# Feedback

Dear Contributor, well done! Your debugging prompt passes the actual guidelines quality threshold. Your prompt is just what is expected. You could improve your follow-up prompt just a little bit to increase the overall quality. Your justifications also are good, and you identified well the non-presence of a deviation. 
Good work!
