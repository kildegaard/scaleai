# Prompts

Generate a script to test the computation of the product of all multiples of even numbers in a given dataset after raising them to the power of 3, while optionally rounding to 3 decimal places. 

Constraints:
No built-in Python functions should be used.
Provide documentation for the code block in the form of comments.
The code should be written in Python



Could you please make the above Python code well-styled & formatted by using code markdown?



# Justifs

Response 1 is well-styled & Formatted, well-documented with comments, and additionally, produces an output. But then, it has some compilation issues or errors wish will not be good for the user. 
Response 1 carried out good computation in its result.

Also, Response 2 lack code markdown. That is the code is not well style & formatted. 
However, Response 2 compiles without any error and it produces output with the right computation. Response 2 is well documented with comments.

In light of this, Response 2 is much better than Response 1.



Response 1 is slightly better than Response 2 because the prompt stated that the Python code should be style & formatted which was done by both responses.

However, Response 1 explains all changes and how the changes were effected in the code. Response 2 did the same but was not as elaborate as Response 1. Of course, this has not made Response 1 better because the prompt has not stated that.

So, Response 1 is slightly better than Response 2.


# notas mias

El prompt es tremendamente sencillo, las constraints que tiene son demasiado sencillas. El follow-up también carece de calidad, contexto y contraints. Se enfoca demasaido en el estilo y el formato cuando esto no es lo primordial.

Las justificaciones se enfocan demasiado en el estilo y el formato, esto es algo totalmente secundario. Falta mencionar la dimensión sobre la cual se produce la desviación, y aclarar que se testeó el código (y cómo se realizó esto).

## Feedback

Dear contributor, your prompt does not align with the actual Guidelines.
Prompts need to adjust to this idea: "A recent college grad that is starting their first job as a junior programmer".

In your case, the prompt is non-complex while the constraints it has are too simple. It looks more like a simple exercise done when learning basic programming. The follow-up prompt also lacks quality, context, and constraints. It focuses too much on style and formatting when this is not the most important thing.

The justifications focus too much on style and format while this is totally secondary. You lack to mention anything about the dimension on which the deviation occurs, and clarification that the code was tested (and how this was done).

I will share some insights with you on this to improve the quality of your prompts and justifications.

Prompts need to have a certain structure considering the following:
- Context: giving some environmental information will buff your prompt as the model has information to be more specific and clever.
- Clear objectives: well-explained goals for the code or problem to achieve.
- Use cases: propose uses for the code to be useful within specific situations
- Constraints: adding extra spice to the model is a good way to increase its quality. Think about specific limitations to take into account or restrictions that would make the problem non-trivial.
- Uniqueness: as stated previously, your problem must provide some fresh ideas to the prompt pool. It's expected for you to write problems that are not so easily found on the internet.
- Complexity: Once again, as stated before, the problem must not be trivial. It would be best if you aimed for issues that require some effort for the model, that provide a clear yet not easy way for solving them.


Another topic to engage in is justifications: in the documentation, there's plenty of information to learn some workflow to tackle this. I'll add them at the end for you to later consults.

Yet another thing that is of extreme importance is to test your code factually (as stated before). Not only test it, but show some evidence that you did, and share the environment set for this. It's important because if the reviewer can not rut it, or if it's too complicated and time-consuming to set the correct environment, then your task is most probably going to be sent back to you. Please consider this!

Keynote for future justifications: I will show you a systematic way of building excellent-quality justifications.

Comparison between responses + Along which dimension? + Epic quality justification + Evidence for taking the aforementioned decision.
Also, you must explain and demonstrate HOW did you test the code, and how (briefly describe the environment). Extra points if you can define how to fix issues (if any).
If you follow these instructions, you will almost always be rated 4 or 5.


With all this, I truly believe you can develop perfect stellar prompts that would make the model thrive to create astonishing responses.

Thanks a lot for reading till the end! I wish you the best on this, I know you have what is needed for the project!
