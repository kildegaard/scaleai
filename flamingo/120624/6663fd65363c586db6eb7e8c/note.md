# Prompt

I need you to write a Python script that manages a soccer tournament.
There are 10 teams, name them as Team 1, Team 2... Team 10.

Simulate 9 rounds where each team plays once, simulate the scores where each team can score from 0 to 3 goals randomly. When a team wins it scores 3 points, if it draws, it scores 1 point and if it loses, it scores 0 points. show me a table with the teams after each round.

At the end of the 9 rounds each team should have faced each of the other teams once, one game per round.

The table should contains games played, games won, games lost, goals scored, goals against, goal difference and points.

After the 9 rounds, I want you to show me a table of the teams with their points arranged from highest to lowest, and tell me who is the champion of the tournament. If there is a tie, it is resolved by goal difference.

# Justif

Response 2 is better than Response 1 along the Relevance and Completeness dimension, hence marking a clear deviation.
In Response 1, each team does not play each other once because there is an incorrect fixture setup. This does not happen on Response 2, which correctly matches each team once using `combinations` from `itertools`.
Also, the table shown in Response 1 lacks proper sorting and columns, while Response 2 assesses this with no problems.
Both Responses compile without issues when tested in a local Visual Studio Code environment.

# Feedback

Dear Contributor, excellent job on this task! You excelled in your prompt and did very well in your justification. I just made minor fixes to it like mentioning the testing and clarifying the deviation.
Good job overall, keep it up!
