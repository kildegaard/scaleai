Hello, dear Tasker!
Here are my comments and corrections on this attempt:

Turn #1:
    Use markdown to print `df.head()`
Turn #2:
    Same as previous turn.
Turn #5:
    When only one of the responses is a final response, both should be tagged as Final Response.

Finally, I fixed some minor things in the last 3 organic lossy responses.

Overall quality of the task: very good indeed! Thanks a lot for your efforts (:
