Hello, dear Tasker!
I have reviewed your task and the overall quality is good. Still, there is some room for improving its quality.
Two main things to consider:
    - Rating justifications must clearly explain what the instruction's issues are. You are not supposed to write down just a few lines; it is expected to be a clear argument on issues found.
    - Also, SxS justifications should be clear enough to understand the response selection. Here, you must write everything that made you decide on one response or another, and it's advisable also to write down which modifications should be present in order to create a perfect response.

Turn #1:
    - Methods should be enclosed between backticks.
    - `head()` should be printed using markdown format.
    - The use of 'Please...' is not recommended.

Turn #3: This step has some things to deal with. From the previous turn, we can see that the first 5 rows have null values. So, the correct way to solve this situation is to find the first row with at least a specific percentage of complete values, let's say 50%.
As such, this would be a Step 3 turn with Scenario 3 involved.

Please, consider these notes when redoing this task from turn #3, and don't hesitate to ask for more advice in War Zoom!
Cheers!!
