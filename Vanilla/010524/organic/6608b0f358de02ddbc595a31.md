Dear tasker, here's my feedback of your attempt.
The overall quality is excelent! There are small details that I fixed:

Turn #1:
    `head()` should be printed using markdown format.
    The use of 'Please...' is not recommended.
Turn #3:
    This step should be marked as "Step 3", not a "Output & Coder Instructions.
    Corrected some columns that weren't between backticks.
    Most important: added a few lines in the Output section to compatibilize it with Scenario 1 situation.
Turn #4:
    Added some lines of code to the plot in order to improve its quality.

Thanks a lot for your effort! This kind of quality is what's expected for the project. Keep it up!
