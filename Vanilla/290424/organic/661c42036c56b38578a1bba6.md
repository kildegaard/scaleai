Turn #1:
    - Columns should be enclosed between backticks.
    - `df.head()` should be printed using `to_markdown()` method.
    - Fixed the SxS and the refined response accordingly.
Turn #2:
    - SxS justification should be more explicit. In this case, it would have been nice to explain what should be modified in both responses in order for them to be perfect ones.
Turn #3:
    - It should be explicit that `Timestamp` column has a consistent 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' (as seen in `df.head()` output), hence generating a Scenario type 2 where direct conversion and use is advisable.
    - Scenario selection in responses must always be the same, as it not depends on the answer, rather on what must be done to answer the original prompt.
