Hello, dear Tasker!
Here are some comments about your task:

Turn #1: 
    - File names should be enclosed between double quotes.
    - The `head()` method should be printed using markdown format.
    - The use of "Please..." is discouraged.
    - The method names should be between backticks.
    - SxS was a bit vague; changed it to better answer chosen response.
Turn #4: 
    - Rating justifications should be more expressive. In this case, the code error should be explained.
Turn #5: 
    - The model uses plural first-person pronouns.

These are just some of the corrected issues.

The most important of this task (that was very good indeed) is the edgy situation management with those 2 anomalous values.
The way this task was solved was not bad, but this raised a big debate in whether Guidelines should contemplate this edgy case.
