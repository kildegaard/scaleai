Hello, dear Tasker!
This is my feedback of the current attempt:

Turn #1:
    - Column names should be between backticks.
    - First turn of EDA should have no Output section.
Turn #3:
    - There should not be a code block in the Output section.
Turn #5:
    - SxS justification was improved to clarify the resposne choice.
Turn #7:
    - The code should have comments explaining its steps.
Turn #8:
    - The table is not formatted well as it does not show the final message "This table is truncated. Let me know if you want me to show all the values" or something like that.

The task was very good! Just keep an eye on the grammar as I found many small errors that needed to be fixed.
Keep it up!
