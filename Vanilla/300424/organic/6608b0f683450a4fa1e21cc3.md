Hello Dear Tasker!
I have reviewed your task and the overall level is very good! However, on Turn #3 there's an issue that must be fixed in order for this task to be approvable.
I will now explain in more detail things that I saw for you to consider when redoing the task.

Turn #1:
    - `head()` must be printed using markdown format.
    - Methods should be between backticks.
    - The use of 'Please...' is discouraged.
    - File's name should be between double quotes.
    - SxS justification must better explain the response chosen.
Turn #3:
    - You should not have arbitrarily excluded `RunQueue` or `Swap-in` from the total sum. By doing this, everything from this point onward is not correct and should be redone in order to maintain this project's quality level.
    - Additionally, as this is a Step 3 turn, it is important to be explicit about which columns must be modified (or not) in order to work with the data.
    - As such, this is Scenario 2, not Scenario 1 (due to the needed conversion of `RunQueue` and `Swap-in` columns). So that too needs to be modified accordingly.

Please, consider these recommendations when redoing this attempt from Turn #3.
If you find any trouble when working on this, don't hesitate to ask us at War Zoom!

Thanks a lot for your time and efforts :)
