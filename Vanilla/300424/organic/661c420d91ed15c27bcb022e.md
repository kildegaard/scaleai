Hello, dear tasker!

I have reviewed your task and the overall level is very good! However, there are some things to be corrected for the task to be even better.
I will now explain in more detail things that I saw for you to consider when redoing the task.

Turn #1:
    - Methods should be enclosed between backticks.
    - The use of 'Please...' is discouraged.
    - `head()` should be printed using markdown format.
Turn #3: this turn has some issues that must be fixed in order for this task to be approvable.
    - As `location` column is 'float64' it needs to be casted to 'string' in order to concatenate it with `locality`. This makes this a Scenario 1 (which you correctly mentioned) and as such must be mentioned in the Output.
    - When printing the dataframe, you must check its length. If it's more than 10 rows, print only 3. Otherwise, print all of them.

Please consider these modifications for redoing the task from turn #3.

Thanks for your efforts!!
