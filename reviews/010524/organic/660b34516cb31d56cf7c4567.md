Hello dear tasker. Here are some fixes and corrections:

Turn #1:
    - Methods should be enclosed between backticks.
    - The use of 'Please...' is discouraged.
    - `head()` should be printed using markdown format.
    - Coder instructions must be list formatted.
Turn #2:
    - Rewrote the Ratings justification to be more expressive.
    - SxS was improved too to specify what must be done for the response to be perfect.
    - Switched to 'Yes' the Coding section and applied the refined code inside the Workspace.
Turn #3:
    - Response 2 must be 'Final Response' as the response type.
    - It should be flagged as 'Not a final response' as well.
    - Refined the final response to improve its quality.

Finally, some organic lossy responses were improved as now the comparison is done against the selected final response.

Good job overall!!
