Hello Dear Tasker!
I have reviewed your task and the overall level is very good! However, on Turn #5 (which is the actually Step 3) you did not raise this situation.
There is a big chance that this was not implemented at that particular moment. Nevertheless, I must send this attempt back to you so this issue can be assessed.
I will now explain in more detail things that I saw for you to consider when redoing the task.

Turn #1:
    - The SxS section, despite being obvious, must be well justified. Yes, they are identical, but also have issues to correct. This is just a recomendation, not an actual issue.
Turn #3:
    - Same as turn #1 with SxS section.
    - When in need to skip rows, you should redo like Step 1 and call `df.head()` and `df.info()`, printing the first one using markdown format. This is to mantain consistency in the overall style.
Turn #4:
    - As previous turn had some details to consider, this one brings the same issues. In this case, printing both `df.head()` and `df.info()` methods
    - Small issue: the code must be always commented to improve readability.

Turn #5: Here is where things go beyond recovery and needs to be redone
    - First of all, this is considered a Step 3 turn, so that must be selected, no Output & Coder Instructions.
    - When in this case, you have a Scenario 1 because you need to filter by 'Cerrada' value on `State` column and this value is seen in the `head()` output.
    - As Scenario 1, this assumption must be stated in the Output section.
    - Finally, when printing rows you must always check for the output's length: if it is more than 10 rows, you must print only the first 3.

Please, consider this suggestions and some already done corrections when redoing the task! Please, if you find any trouble when working on this, don't hesitate in asking us at War Zoom!

Thanks a lot for your time and efforts :)
