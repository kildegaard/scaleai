The model tried to improve the code's style by reducing redundancy in the code, improving its readability, destructuring arrays for more clarity in the code, and modifying function names to more descriptive and consistent ones.
However, there are several issues that still can be further improved. The use of semicolons at the end of the line in JavaScript is not required. Also, the code readability could further be improved by adding JSDoc comments. Using `let` and not only `const` for variable creation is a better approach, too. The use of `mathjs` is not really necessary for the code to work flawlessly, so it could be avoided to get a cleaner code. Finally, another improvement can be made by rounding the slope and intercept to three decimals, for example, to avoid having 15 decimals that usually are not needed nor are representative.
